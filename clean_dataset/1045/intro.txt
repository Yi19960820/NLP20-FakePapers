Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in the liver is widely used for detecting hepatic lesions and in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions. However, such images often suffer from motion artifacts due to unpredictable respiration, dyspnea, or mismatches in k-space caused by rapid injection of the contrast agent _cite_ _cite_ . In DCE-MRI, a series of TN-weighted MR images is obtained after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-based MR contrast agent, such as gadoxetic acid. However, acquiring appropriate data sets for DCE arterial phase MR images is difficult due to the limited scan time available in the first pass of the contrast agent. Furthermore, it has been reported that transient dyspnea can be caused by gadoxetic acid at a non-negligible frequency _cite_ _cite_, which results in degraded image quality due to respiratory motion-related artifacts such as blurring and ghosting _cite_ . Especially, coherent ghosting originating from the anterior abdominal wall decrease diagnostic performance of the images _cite_ Recently, many strategies have been proposed to avoid motion artifacts in DCE-MRI. Of these, fast acquisition strategies using compressed sensing may provide the simplest way to avoid motion artifacts in the liver _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . Compressed sensing is an acquisition and reconstruction technique based on the sparsity of the signal, and the k-space undersampling results in a shorter scan time. Zhang et al. demonstrated that DCE-MRI with a high acceleration factor of N using compressed sensing provides significantly better image quality than conventional parallel imaging _cite_ . Other approaches include data acquisition without breath holding (free-breathing method) using respiratory triggering and respiratory triggered DCE-MRI, which is an effective technique to reduce motion artifacts in cases of patients who are unable to suspend their respiration _cite_ _cite_ .In these approaches, sequence acquisitions are triggered based on respiratory tracings or navigator echoes, and typically provide a one-dimensional projection of abdominal images. Shreyas et al. found that the image quality in acquisitions with navigator echoes under free-breathing conditions is significantly improved. Although triggering based approaches successfully reduce the motion artifacts, it is not possible to appropriately time arterial phase image acquisition due to the long scan times required to acquire an entire dataset. In addition, miss-triggers often occur in cases of unstable patient respiration, which causes artifacts and blurring of the images. Recently, a radial trajectory acquisition method with compressed sensing was proposed _cite_ _cite_, which enables high-temporal resolution imaging without breath holding in DCE-MRI. However, the image quality of radial acquisition without breath holding is worse than that with breath holding even though the clinical usefulness of radial trajectory acquisition has been demonstrated in many papers _cite_ _cite_ . _cite_ Post-processing artifact reduction techniques using deep learning approaches have been also been proposed. Deep learning, which is used in complex non-linear processing applications, is a machine learning technique that relies on a neural network with a large number of hidden layers. Han et al. proposed a denoising algorithm using a multi-resolution convolutional network called “U-Net” to remove the streak artifacts induced in images obtained via radial acquisition _cite_ .In addition, aliasing artifact reduction has been demonstrated in several papers as an alternative to compressed sensing reconstruction _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . The results of several feasibility studies of motion artifact reduction in the brain _cite_ _cite_ _cite_, abdomen _cite_, and cervical spine _cite_ have also been reported. Although these post-processing techniques have been studied extensively, no study has ever demonstrated practical artifact reduction in DCE-MRI of the liver. In this study, a motion artifact reduction method was developed based on a convolutional network (MARC) for DCE-MRI of the liver that removes motion artifacts from input MR images. Both simulations and experiments were conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.
