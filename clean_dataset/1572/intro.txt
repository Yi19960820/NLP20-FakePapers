Deep learning has been applied in many different research fields to solve complicated problems~ _cite_, made possible through parallel computing and big datasets. Acquiring a large annotated medical imaging dataset can be rather challenging for classification problems (e.g. discriminating healthy and diseased subjects), as one training example then corresponds to one subject~ _cite_ . Data augmentation, e.g. rotation, cropping and scaling, is normally used to increase the amount of training data, but can only provide limited alternative data. A more advanced data augmentation technique, generative adversarial networks (GANs) ~ _cite_, uses two competing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ; one that generates new samples from noise and one that that discriminates samples as real or synthetic. The most obvious application of a GAN in medical imaging is to generate additional realistic training data, to improve classification performance (see e.g. ~ _cite_ and~ _cite_) . Another application is to use GANs for image-to-image translation, e.g. to generate computed tomography (CT) data from magnetic resonance (MR) images or vice versa. This can for example be very useful for multimodal classification of healthy and diseased subjects, where several types of medical images (e.g. CT and MRI) are combined to improve sensitivity (see e.g.~ _cite_ and~ _cite_) . To use GANs for image-to-image translation in medical imaging is not a new idea. Nie et al.~ _cite_ used a GAN to generate CT data from MRI. Yang et al.~ _cite_ recently used GANs to improve registration and segmentation of MR images, by generating new data and using multimodal algorithms. Similarly, Dar et al.~ _cite_ demonstrate how GANs can be used for generation of a TN-weighted MR image from a TN-weighted image. However, since GANs have only recently been proposed for image-to-image translation, and new GAN models are still being developed, it is not clear what the best GAN model is and how GANs should be evaluated and compared. We therefore present a small comparison for image-to-image translation of TN-and TN-weighted MR images. Compared to previous work~ _cite_ which used conditional GANs (cGAN) ~ _cite_, we show results for our own Keras implementations of CycleGAN~ _cite_ and UNIT~ _cite_, see https: //github.com/simontomaskarlsson/GAN-MRI for code.
