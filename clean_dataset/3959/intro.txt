Medical image classification can be an important component of many computer aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) systems. Achieving high accuracies for automated classification of anatomy is a challenging task, given the vast scope of anatomic variation. In this work, our aim is to automatically classify axial CT images into \Nclasses anatomical classes (see Fig. _ref_) . This aim is achieved by mining radiological reports that refer to key-images and associated DICOM image tags manually in order to establish a ground truth for training and testing. Using computer vision and medical image computing techniques, we were able to train the computer to replicate these classes with low error rates.
