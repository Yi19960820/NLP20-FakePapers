re-identification~ (Re-ID) is an important task for many surveillance applications such as person association~ _cite_, multi-target tracking~ _cite_ and behavior analysis~ _cite_ . Given a pedestrian image from one camera view, it tries to find out the stated person amongst a set of gallery candidates captured from the disjoint camera views. The person Re-ID problem has attracted extensive research attentions in recent years, and yet it still remains a challenging one due to the large cross-view appearance variations caused by mutual occlusions and background clutters. Therefore, the key to improve the person Re-ID performance is to learn a discriminative feature representation which is robust to the large cross-view appearance variations. To address this problem, extensive works have been reported in the past few years, which could be roughly divided into the following two categories: N) developing discriminative descriptors to handle the variations of person's appearance, and N) designing distinctive distance metrics to measure the similarity between images. In the first line of works, different informative feature descriptors have been attempted by utilizing different clues, including the LBP~ _cite_, ELF~ _cite_ and LOMO~ _cite_ . In the second line of works, labeled images are used to learn effective distance metrics, including the LADF~ _cite_, LMNN~ _cite_ and ITML~ _cite_ . An evident drawback of these methods is that they consider feature extraction and metric learning as two independent steps, and therefore they cannot complement their capabilities in a joint framework. Benefit from the strong representation capacity of deep neural network, the deep feature learning based methods~ _cite_ have significantly improved the person Re-ID results on the public benchmark datasets. These methods are usually consisted of two components, {\em i.e.}, a neural network and an objective function. Specifically, the neural network is built to extract features from input images, and the objective function is designed to guide the training process. Representative deep neural networks include the AlexNet~ _cite_, VGGNet~ _cite_ and ResNet~ _cite_, and representative objective functions include the softmax loss function~ _cite_, triplet loss function~ _cite_ and contrastive loss function~ _cite_ . These works usually take the entire rectangular images as inputs, therefore the extracted features may easily get degenerated by the background noises. In order to solve this problem, several works~ _cite_ have been presented to address the foreground persons in feature learning, which are implemented in two steps: N) Learn two kinds of features from both the complete and masked images using a multi-path network; and N) Concatenate the multi-path features and fuse them at the output layers. Because they use a multi-path network to extract features, heavy computations are needed at both the training and testing stages. In this paper, we incorporate a foreground attentive neural network~ (FANN) and a symmetric triplet loss function into an end-to-end feature learning framework, so as to learn a discriminative feature representation from the foreground images for person Re-ID. As illustrated in Fig.~ _ref_, a detected person in a rectangular image region may easily include background clutters and mutual occlusions from the other objects. If such noises can be attenuated, the extracted features will mainly come from the foreground persons, which are more discriminative and robust to the large cross-view appearance variations. This observation has motivated us to propose a novel multi-task learning framework that can jointly alleviate the side effects of backgrounds and learn the discriminative features from foregrounds. Specifically, a novel FANN is built to focus its attention on the foreground persons, in which each image is first passed through an encoder and decoder network, then the outputs of encoder network are further taken for the discriminative feature learning. The encoder network extracts features from the whole image, and the decoder network reconstructs a binary mask of each foreground person. As a result, the encoder network will gradually focus its attention on the foreground persons with the regularization of decoder network by using a novel local regression loss function. Besides, a novel symmetric triplet loss function is introduced to learn the discriminative features, in which the intra-class distance is minimized and the inter-class distance is maximized in each triplet unit, simultaneously. Training the FANN in an end-to-end manner, the foreground attentive features can be finally learned to distinguish different individuals across the disjoint camera views. Extensive experimental results on the NDPeS~ _cite_, VIPeR~ _cite_, CUHKN~ _cite_, CUHKN~ _cite_, MarketN~ _cite_ and DukeMTMC-reID~ _cite_ datasets have shown the significant improvements by our method, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.
