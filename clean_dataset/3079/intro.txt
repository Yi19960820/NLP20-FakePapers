Face recognition, being a highly non-intrusive biometric~ _cite_, is fast becoming the tool of choice~ _cite_ in the domains of surveillance (for example, border control, suspect tracking, identification), security (for example, system login, banking, file encryption) and entertainment (for example, human computer interaction, ND animation, virtual reality) . Advancements in Deep Learning have brought about revolutionary improvements in various computer vision tasks where CNN based face recognition is claimed to have surpassed human performance~ _cite_ . However, the recent MegaFace challenges~ _cite_ have shattered this myth, revealing that face recognition is still an unsolved problem. Two-dimensional face recognition using CNNs on conventional photographs has shown remarkable performance on benchmarks like LFW~ _cite_ and Janus~ _cite_ . One of the main factors for this accomplishment is the ability of CNNs to learn from massive training data which is readily available. For instance, FaceNet~ _cite_ was trained on NM textured images of NM identities while VGG-Face~ _cite_ used N photos of N, N distinct subjects for training. Despite this phenomenal performance and availability of data, ND face recognition is challenged by changes in illumination, pose and scale~ _cite_ . Furthermore, facial texture is not always stable for identities as it can change with make up. On the other hand, ND face recognition has the potential to address these shortcomings. Although this modality in face recognition is gaining popularity~ _cite_, literature survey shows that there is no deep CNN designed specifically for ND face recognition. This is primarily because of the lack of huge amounts of ND training and test data. ND face data cannot be obtained by crawling the web~ _cite_ and it requires great efforts to collect a respectable sized dataset. For instance, the largest publicly available ND face dataset, ND-N~ _cite_ (a superset of FRGCvN~ _cite_) has only N, N scans of _inline_eq_ unique identities and took over two years to collect. The problem of addressing the dearth of labeled ND face data for training CNNs has been addressed through data augmentation. This is either done by creating synthetic faces from an existing ND face model~ _cite_ or by manipulating the facial appearance of existing data by introducing expressions~ _cite_ . The former method is restricted to the linear space of the specific model resulting in faces with confined shape variations. The latter method only generates more scans per subject without increasing the number of unique identities in the data. In this paper, we present a technique for data augmentation that introduces non-linear heterogeneous variations in ND shape, facial expressions, pose and occlusions to generate a training dataset of N ND scans of NK unique identities. The closest numbers in literature~ _cite_ for fine tuning VGG-Face on depth images are NK scans of N identities, several orders of magnitude lower than ours (See Table~ _ref_ for details) . Another notable challenge to face recognition systems is the need for large-scale of test data. Recognition accuracies on small datasets like LFW (_inline_eq_ ~ _cite_) and FRGCvN (_inline_eq_ ~ _cite_) have already saturated indicating the need for larger gallery sizes as it is well known that increasing the gallery size degrades the face recognition performance. The MegaFace Challenges~ _cite_ show that the performance of even the best ND face recognition networks drop significantly when the gallery size increases. The identification accuracy of VGG network with triplet loss reduced by more than _inline_eq_ on FaceScrub when only _inline_eq_ distractors were added to the gallery set~ _cite_ . FaceNet~ _cite_ behaved similarly when one million distractors were added to the gallery~ _cite_ . Literature has no such statistics for ND face recognition as large-scale ND face recognition has never been attempted. Absence of large ND face datasets with huge galleries is the prime reason for this massive gap in research. While millions of ND face datasets have been generated by crawling the Internet~ _cite_, ND domain still depends on physical collection of data from real subjects. We present a unique solution by merging the most challenging publicly available ND face datasets for large-scale face recognition testing. Our gallery consists of N, N identities while the probe set contains N, N ND scans of these individuals. Through extensive experiments, we show how existing methods and CNN models perform on this large scale dataset. We use the challenging protocol of a single sample per identity in the gallery as, most often than not, this would be the case in practical real world scenarios. Note that in the domain of ND face recognition, the largest dataset (FRGCvN~ _cite_) on which results have mostly been reported has only _inline_eq_ identities in the gallery. Apart from data, the recognition algorithm itself is a very important component. The literature contains a variety of state-of-the-art deep CNN architectures for ND face recognition~ _cite_ . Using networks trained on ND images to perform ND face recognition is simplistic and suboptimal as ND data has its own peculiarities defined by the underlying shape and geometry. To the best of our knowledge, there is no deep network designed specifically for ND face recognition. We cover this research gap and propose a Deep ND Face recognition Network coined FRNDNet (pronounced frednet) suited for ND face data and trained from scratch on N ND faces. We also analyze the affects of input image sizes and suitability of kernel sizes for ND faces. In a nutshell, our contributions are as follows: (N) Training Data: We present a method for generating a large corpus of labeled ND face data for training CNNs. Our dataset contains N ND scans of NK identities highly rich in shape variations. Our training data does not include the public datasets. (N) Large-scale Test Data: Owing to the limitations of physically collecting huge ND datasets, we merge the most challenging existing public ND face datasets and propose a protocol for large-scale face recognition using a single sample per identity in the gallery. The test data contains N, N ND scans of N, N identities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest gallery size of ND faces on which ~ face ~ recognition ~ results ~ have ~ ever been reported. (N) Deep ND Face Recognition Network (FRNDNet): We propose the first ever deep CNN designed specifically for ND face recognition and trained on N ND faces. We fine tune FRNDNet on the N, N gallery identities in our large-scale dataset and achieve an end-to-end Rank-N recognition rate of _inline_eq_ on NK probes, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on constituent datasets. The trained and end-to-end fine tuned FRNDNet will be made public.
