Recently, many methods to interpret and visualize deep neural network predictions have been proposed and significant progress has been made. However, a more class-discriminative and visually pleasing explanation is required. Thus, this paper proposes a region-based approach that estimates feature importance in terms of appropriately segmented regions. By fusing the saliency maps generated from multi-scale segmentations, a more class-discriminative and visually pleasing map is obtained. We incorporate this regional multi-scale concept into a prediction difference method that is model-agnostic. An input image is segmented in several scales using the super-pixel method, and exclusion of a region is simulated by sampling a normal distribution constructed using the boundary prior. The experimental results demonstrate that the regional multi-scale method produces much more class-discriminative and visually pleasing saliency maps.
