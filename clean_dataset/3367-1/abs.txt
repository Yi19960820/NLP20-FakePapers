Early works on medical image compression date to the N's with the impetus on deployment of teleradiology systems for high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. Commercially deployed systems during the period could compress N, N _inline_eq_ N, N sized images at N bpp to N bpp using lossless arithmetic coding, and over the years JPEG and JPEGN were imbibed reaching upto N bpp. Inspired by the reprise of deep learning based compression for natural images over the last two years, we propose a fully convolutional autoencoder for diagnostically relevant feature preserving lossy compression. This is followed by leveraging arithmetic coding for encapsulating high redundancy of features for further high-density code packing leading to variable bit length. We demonstrate performance on two different publicly available digital mammography datasets using peak signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index and domain adaptability tests between datasets. At high density compression factors of _inline_eq_ N _inline_eq_ (N bpp), our approach rivals JPEG and JPEGN as evaluated through a Radiologist's visual Turing test.
