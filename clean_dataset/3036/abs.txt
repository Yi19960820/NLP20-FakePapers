We propose a computationally efficient and high-performance classification algorithm by incorporating class structural information in analysis dictionary learning. To achieve more consistent classification, we associate a class characteristic structure of independent subspaces and impose it on the classification error constrained analysis dictionary learning. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of visual classification tasks. In addition, our method greatly reduces the training and testing computational complexity.
