Control of blood glucose is essential for diabetes management. Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with Type N diabetes mellitus (TNDM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = N _inline_eq_ N [mg/dL] over a N-minute horizon, RMSE = N _inline_eq_ N [mg/dL] over a N-minute horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE = N _inline_eq_ N [mg/dL] for N-minute, RMSE = N _inline_eq_ N \% for N-minute) . In addition, the model provides competitive performance in providing effective prediction horizon (_inline_eq_) with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset (_inline_eq_ = N _inline_eq_ N for N-min and _inline_eq_ = N _inline_eq_ N for N-min) and in a real patient dataset (_inline_eq_ = N _inline_eq_ N for N-min and _inline_eq_ = N _inline_eq_ N for N-min) . This approach is evaluated on a dataset of N simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of N real cases each containing glucose readings, insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. Performance of the recurrent convolutional neural network is benchmarked against four algorithms. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an Android mobile phone, with an execution time of _inline_eq_ ms on a phone compared to an execution time of _inline_eq_ ms on a laptop.
