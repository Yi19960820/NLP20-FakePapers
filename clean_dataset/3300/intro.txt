Object detection is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. Its goal is to detect objects by classifying and regressing bounding boxes in an image _cite_ . It has received much attention because of its wide range of applications, such as object tracking _cite_, surveillance _cite_, and face detection _cite_ . Most of the state-of-the-art detectors show significant performance improvements based on deep convolutional neural networks. Despite the advances in object detection, it is still difficult to assign correct detections for all objects in an image since detectors do not distinguish different object instances in the same class as it only focuses on an instance-agnostic task, i.e., object category classification. This issue becomes critical when objects are overlapped. As shown in the left image of Figure~ _ref_, the person on the right is not detected due to the overlapped bounding boxes in proximity. In order to address this issue, we propose an instance-aware detection network (IDNet), which learns to differentiate representations of different objects. IDNet learns the similarity among bounding boxes during training and selects a subset of boxes based on the learned similarity during inference. Specifically, IDNet learns to compare appearances of bounding boxes while considering their spatial arrangements. IDNet uses an existing detector, such as Faster R-CNN, as a component to obtain candidate bounding boxes. Given candidate boxes, IDNet extracts features of all candidates using a CNN branch, named a region identification network (RIN), which aims to increase the probability of selecting an optimal subset of detections. To this end, IDNet is trained not only with the softmax loss and smooth LN loss _cite_, but also with novel losses based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) _cite_ . A DPP is used in various machine learning fields, such as document and video summarization _cite_, sensor placement _cite_, recommendation systems _cite_ and multi-label classification _cite_, to select a desirable subset from a set of candidates. Using the property of repulsiveness in DPPs, we design an instance-aware detection loss (ID loss), which learns to increase the probability of selecting an instance-aware subset from detection candidates. Another source of the detection error is multiple detections of different classes for a single object. This error has been known to be one of the persistent problems for instance-agnostic detectors, such as Faster R-CNN _cite_ . For example, as shown in the right image of Figure~ _ref_, there are two bounding boxes categorized as a dog and a horse for the same object. Since the objective of a detector is to find a single bounding box for a single object instance, we propose the sparse-score loss (SS loss) using DPPs to make IDNet assign a single bounding box for a single object, considering all categories. In particular, we formulate the SS loss to remove duplicated bounding boxes by training IDNet to have low confidence scores for bounding boxes with incorrect class labels. After training, our algorithm efficiently finds a subset of candidate detections using the log-submodular property of DPPs _cite_ . Experimental results show that IDNet is more robust for detecting overlapped objects against the baseline detectors, such as Faster R-CNN _cite_ and learning detection with diverse proposals (LDDP) _cite_, on PASCAL VOC _cite_ and MS COCO _cite_ . Our IDNet achieves N \% mAP improvement on PASCAL VOC N and N \% mAP improvement on PASCAL VOC N over Faster R-CNN when tested on the VOC crowd set, which consists of images with overlapped objects. For COCO, the performance is improved by N \% AP when tested on the COCO crowd set. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (N) Two novel losses, the sparse-score loss and the instance-aware diversity loss, are proposed for instance-aware detection; (N) To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first approach that trains a neural network to learn quality and diversity terms of a DPP for object detection; (N) The proposed algorithm outperforms baseline detectors for detecting overlapped objects.
