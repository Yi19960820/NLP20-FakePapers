Attention is widely studied in neuroscience and becoming popular in deep learning as well, with particular applicability to image processing. While attention comes in many forms, spatial-based attention is most prominently featured in both fields. Feature-based attention, however, also engenders benefits for visual processing, and could be of use to artificial vision. Here, I briefly review some uses of attention in CNNs and introduce feature-based attention, which is a spatially-global alteration to a pre-trained CNN, applied in a category-specific way. More simply, using mechanisms inspired by biology, FBA applied to a given category works by biasing activity in the CNN towards the average activity pattern created by that category. This enhances detection of a given object class using a single feedforward pass of the CNN.
