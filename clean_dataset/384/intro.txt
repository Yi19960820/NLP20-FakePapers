Face grouping is an actively researched computer vision problem due to its enormous potential in commercial applications. It not only allows users to organize and tag photos based on faces but also retrieve and revisit huge quantity of relevant images effortlessly. The performance of face grouping significantly benefits from the recent emergence of deep learning approaches~ _cite_ . Nevertheless, we still observe some challenges when we apply existing methods on real-world photo albums. In particular, we found that deeply learned representation can still perform poorly given profile faces and false detections . In addition, there is no obvious mechanism to disambiguate large quantity of non-interested faces that are captured under the same condition with the person of interests. We provide an illustrative example in Fig.~ _ref_, of which results were obtained from the Inception-vN model~ _cite_ fine-tuned with MS-Celeb-NM~ _cite_ images with face identity. Despite the model achieves an accuracy of N \% on LFW~ _cite_, which is on par with the accuracy reported by a state-of-the-art method~ _cite_, its performance on the open-world face grouping task is unsatisfactory. We attempted to adapt the deep model with open-world albums~ _cite_ but with limited success. We show experimental results in Sec.~ _ref_ . Learning such an open-world model is still far from being solved due to highly imbalanced data (much more frontal faces compared to profile instances in existing datasets) and a large negative space to cover. Thinking about humans, we tend to execute a visual grouping task in sequence with intermediate decision to govern our next step, like playing a jigsaw puzzle~ _cite_ with pieces of varying visual complexity. First we will link pieces with strong correlation and high confidence, then gain insights and accumulate visual evidence from these stable clusters. Consequently, a larger group can be formed through merging ambiguous positives and discarding uninteresting outliers. In the process, we may exploit contextual cues and global picture considering other samples. The above intuition motivates a novel face grouping framework. Our goal is not to design a better deep representation, but learning to make better merging/not-merging decision from expert?s demonstration using existing representation. In particular, we wish to introduce intermediate sequential decision between the clustering steps, \ie, when to merge two samples or groups given the dynamic context. Towards this goal, we assume different clustering states, where the states differ in their current partitions of data. At each time step, an agent will choose from two possible actions, \ie, to merge or not to merge a pair of face groups. The process responds at the next time step by moving to a new state and provides a reward to the agent. A sequence of good actions would lead to higher accumulative reward than suboptimal decisions. Learning a decision strategy in our problem is non-trivial. In particular, the decision process is adversely affected by uninteresting faces and noisy detections. Defining a reward function for face grouping is thus not straightforward, which needs to consider the similarity of faces, group consistency, and quality of images. In addition, we also need to consider the operation cost involved, \ie, the manual human effort spent on adding or removing a photo from a group. It is hard to determine the relative weights of these terms a-priori. This is in contrast to (first person) imitation learning setting of which the reward is usually assumed known and fixed, \eg, using the change of game score~ _cite_ . \noindent Contributions: We make the following contributions to overcome the aforementioned challenges: \noindent N) We formulate a novel face grouping framework based on imitation learning (IL) via inverse reinforcement learning~ _cite_ . To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address visual clustering via inverse reinforcement learning. Once learned, the policy can be transferred to unseen photo albums with good generalization performance. \noindent N) We assume the reward as an unknown to be ascertained through learning by watching an expert's behavior. We formulate the learning such that both short-and long-terms rewards are considered. The formal considers similarity, consistency and quality of local candidate clusters; whereas the latter measures the operation cost to get from an arbitrary photos partition to the final ground-truth partition. The new reward system effectively handles the challenges of profile, noisy, and uninteresting faces, and works well with conventional face similarity under an open-world context. \noindent N) We introduce a large-scale dataset called Grouping Faces in the Wild (GFW) to facilitate the research of real-world photo grouping. The new dataset contains _inline_eq_ faces of _inline_eq_ identities collected from a social network. This dataset is realistic, providing a large number of uninteresting faces and noisy detections. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets, namely, LFW simulated albums, ACCIO dataset (Harry Potter movie) ~ _cite_, and the GFW introduced by us. We show that the proposed method can be adapted to a variety of clustering algorithms, from the conventional k-means and hierarchical clustering to the more elaborated graph degree linkage (GDL) approach~ _cite_ . We show that it outperforms a number of unsupervised and supervised baselines.
