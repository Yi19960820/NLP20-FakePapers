Since the AlexNet~ _cite_ sparked off the passion for research on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNNs have been improving the performance of image classification continuously. And heterogeneous successive brilliant CNN models lead this wave with compelling results, besides, state of the art of various vision tasks, such as detection~ _cite_ and segmentation~ _cite_, is advancing rapidly leveraging the power of CNN. A number of recent papers~ _cite_ have tried to lend insights on interpretability of CNN. These methods focus on understanding CNN by visualizing learned representations. An interesting conclusion~ _cite_ has been drawn that CNN has ability to localize objects without any supervision in classification task. As shown in Figure~ _ref_, we visualize the VGGN using Grad-CAM~ _cite_ . We posit that single network may not notice all informative regions or details which leads to misclassification as exhibited in Figure~ _ref_, meaning focusing on specific areas since some different categories may have these regions in similar. Based on this point, in this paper we propose a parallel networks architecture dubbed D-PCN, which coordinates parallel networks to achieve diverse representations under the guide of a discriminator. The final prediction is reported by the extra classifier. We adopt a training method which is modified from adversarial learning to achieve our goal. We implement D-PCN on CIFAR-N~ _cite_, ImageNet _cite_ datasets with NIN~ _cite_, ResNet~ _cite_, WRN~ _cite_, ResNeXt~ _cite_ and DenseNet~ _cite_ . In experiments, the performance of D-PCN ascends greatly compared with single base CNN, and it's proved that performance improvement is not merely from more parameters. In particular, our method has outperformed all advanced related approaches which use multiple subnetworks on CIFAR-N. We also apply Grad-CAM~ _cite_ to visualize D-PCN with VGGN~ _cite_ on a fine-grained classification dataset, Stanford Dogs~ _cite_, and the result verifies our motivation. In addition, we introduce D-PCN into FCN~ _cite_ on PASCAL VOC N segmentation task, and experiment result demonstrates that D-PCN enhances the network. We summarize our contributions as follows:
