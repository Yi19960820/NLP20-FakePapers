<|startoftext|> We present a deep-learning approach to restore a sequence of turbulence-distorted images from turbulent deformations and space-time varying blurs. Instead of requiring a massive training sample size in deep networks, we propose a training strategy that is based on a data augmentation method to model the turbulence from a relatively small dataset. Then we incorporate a subsampling method into the deep network to enhance the restoration performance of the trained {\bf GAN} model. The contribution of the paper is threefold: First, we introduce a simple but effective data augmentation algorithm to model the turbulence for training in the deep network; Second, we propose the {\bf W} asserstein {\bf GAN} combined with the multiframe input and _inline_eq_ cost for successful restoration of turbulence-corrupted video sequence; Third, we incorporate a subsampling algorithm into the deep network to filter out strongly corrupted frames so as to obtain an improved restored image. <|endoftext|>
