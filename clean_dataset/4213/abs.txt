This paper presents a novel Robust Deep Appearance Models to learn the non-linear correlation between shape and texture of face images. In this approach, two crucial components of face images, i.e. shape and texture, are represented by Deep Boltzmann Machines and Robust Deep Boltzmann Machines (RDBM), respectively. The RDBM, an alternative form of Robust Boltzmann Machines, can separate corrupted/occluded pixels in the texture modeling to achieve better reconstruction results. The two models are connected by Restricted Boltzmann Machines at the top layer to jointly learn and capture the variations of both facial shapes and appearances. This paper also introduces new fitting algorithms with occlusion awareness through the mask obtained from the RDBM reconstruction. The proposed approach is evaluated in various applications by using challenging face datasets, i.e. Labeled Face Parts in the Wild (LFPW), Helen, EURECOM and AR databases, to demonstrate its robustness and capabilities.
