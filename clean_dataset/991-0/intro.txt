Multiple Target Tracking (MTT) is the task of extracting the continuous path of relevant objects across a set of subsequent frames. Due to the recent advances in object detection~ _cite_, the problem of MTT is often addressed within the paradigm. Detections are previously extracted independently in each frame and then objects trajectories are built by maximizing specifically designed coherence functions~ _cite_ . Tracking objects through detections can mitigate drifting behaviors introduced by prediction steps but, on the other hand, it forces the tracker to work in adverse conditions, due to the frequent occurrence of false and miss detections. The majority of approaches address MTT offline, ~by exploiting detections from a set of frames~ _cite_ through global optimization. Offline methods benefit from the bigger portion of video sequence they dispose of to establish spatio-temporal coherence, but can not be used in real-time applications. Conversely, online methods track the targets frame-by-frame; they have a larger spectra of application but must be both accurate and fast despite working with less data. In this context, the robustness of the features play a major role in the online MTT task. Some approaches claim the adoption of complex targets models~ _cite_ to be the solution, while others argue that this complexity may affect the long-term robustness~ _cite_ . For instance, in large crowds people appearance is rarely informative. As a consequence, tracking robustness is often achieved by focusing on spatial features~ _cite_, finding them more reliable than visual ones. We do believe that many of the ambiguities in tracking could be solved by a selective use of the features, by working with more reliable features if possible and exploiting a deeper representation of the target only if necessary. In fact, a simple spatial association is often sufficient while, as clutter or confusion arise, an improved association scheme on more complex features is needed (Fig.~ _ref_) . \noindent In this paper a novel approach for online MTT in static camera scenes is proposed. The method selects the most suitable features to solve the frame-by-frame associations depending on the surrounding scene complexity. Specifically, our contributions are: The algorithm works by alternating between (a) learning the affinity measure of the Correlation Clustering as a latent variable and (b) learning the optimal combinations for both simple and complex features to be used as cost functions by the Hungarian. Results on public benchmarks underline a major improvement in tracking accuracy over current state of the art online trackers (+ N \% MOTA) . \noindent The work takes inspiration from the human perceptive behavior, further introduced in Sec.~ _ref_ . According to the widely accepted two-streams hypothesis by Goodale and Milner~ _cite_, the use of motion and appearance information is localized in the temporal lobe (pathway), while basic spatial cues are processed in the parietal lobe (pathway) . This suggests our brain processes and exploits information in different and specific ways as well.
