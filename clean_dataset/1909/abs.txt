We introduce a novel uncertainty estimation for classification tasks for Bayesian convolutional neural networks with variational inference. By normalizing the output of a Softplus function in the final layer, we estimate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a coherent manner. The intractable posterior probability distributions over weights are inferred by Bayes by Backprop . Firstly, we demonstrate how this reliable variational inference method can serve as a fundamental construct for various network architectures. On multiple datasets in supervised learning settings (MNIST, CIFAR-N, CIFAR-N), this variational inference method achieves performances equivalent to frequentist inference in identical architectures, while the two desiderata, a measure for uncertainty and regularization are incorporated naturally. Secondly, we examine how our proposed measure for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties is derived and validate it on the aforementioned datasets.
