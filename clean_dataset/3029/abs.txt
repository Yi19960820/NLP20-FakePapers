Spatial and temporal features are two key and complementary information for human action recognition. In order to make full use of the intra-frame spatial characteristics and inter-frame temporal relationships, we propose the Squeeze-and-Excitation Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (SE-LRCN) for human action recognition. The Squeeze and Excitation operations are used to implement the feature recalibration. In SE-LRCN, Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet-N (SE-ResNet-N) network is adopted to extract spatial features to enhance the dependencies and importance of feature channels of pixel granularity. We also propose the Squeeze-and-Excitation Long Short-Term Memory (SE-LSTM) network to model the temporal relationship, and to enhance the dependencies and importance of feature channels of frame granularity. We evaluate the proposed model on two challenging benchmarks, HMDBN and UCFN, and the proposed SE-LRCN achieves the competitive results with the state-of-the-art.
