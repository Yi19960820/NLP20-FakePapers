Recent advances in deep convolutional networks have driven tremendous progress in a variety of challenging face processing tasks including face recognition _cite_, face alignment _cite_, and face detection _cite_ . However, humans not only read objective properties from a face, such as gender, expression, race, age and identity, but also form subjective impressions of the social aspects of a face _cite_, such as facial attractiveness _cite_, friendliness, trustworthiness _cite_, sociability, dominance _cite_, and typicality. Despite the relative less attention received by the social perception of faces, social judgment is an important part of people's daily interactions, and it has significant impact on social outcomes, ranging from electoral success to sentencing decisions _cite_ . Whereas current computer vision techniques exceed human abilities at recognizing a face and identifying the objective properties of a face _cite_, awareness of human subjective judgments is important for social robotics theory-of-mind inferences. Accurate predictions of social aspects of faces can help robots better understand how humans interact with and perceive each other, and can make a robot aware of inherent human biases, as these judgments rarely correspond to reality (except, perhaps, attractiveness) _cite_ . In this paper, we teach a machine to infer social impressions, that match human judgments, from faces. We examine a list of N pairs of social features that are typically studied by social psychologists, and that are relevant to social interactions between people ~ _cite_ . Examples are attractiveness~ _cite_, trustworthiness~ _cite_, sociability, aggressiveness~ _cite_, friendliness, kindness, happiness, familiarity~ _cite_, and memorability~ _cite_) . Although social perceptions of faces are subjective, there is often a consensus among human raters in how they perceive facial attractiveness, trustworthiness and dominance _cite_ . This indicates that faces contain high-level visual cues for social interactions, and therefore it is possible to model this process with machine learning techniques. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art neural network models trained for object recognition and face recognition tasks and use their internal representations for social perception learning. In all N social dimensions, our model correlates with human averaged ratings better than the humans correlate with each other.

Section _ref_ and _ref_ summarize the methodology and the experimental framework. The experimental results and visualizations are presented in Section _ref_ and _ref_ .
