Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve N top-N test error on the ImageNet N classification dataset. This is a N \% relative improvement over the ILSVRC N winner (GoogLeNet, N \% _cite_) . To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (N \%, _cite_) on this visual recognition challenge.
