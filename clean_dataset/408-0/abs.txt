Compressed sensing (CS) is a sampling theory that allows reconstruction of sparse (or compressible) signals from an incomplete number of measurements, using of a sensing mechanism implemented by an appropriate . The CS theory is based on random Gaussian projection matrices, which satisfy recovery guarantees with high probability; however, sparse ternary _inline_eq_ projections are more suitable for hardware implementation. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to obtain very sparse ternary projections for compressed sensing. Our deep learning architecture jointly learns a pair of a projection matrix and a reconstruction operator in an end-to-end fashion. The experimental results on real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant advantage in terms of complexity.
