According to the CDC (), there are more than N, N US deaths annually due to pneumonia. However, the best way currently to diagnose a patient with pneumonia early is with chest X-rays, which require an expert radiologist's eye to analyze. This results in a fairly long turn around that many hospitals would like to reduce. CheXNet (), a machine learning algorithm that can analyze chest X-rays in bulk, was built to help solve this problem. In this paper, we improved slightly upon CheXNet, by allowing the network to take in additional information about the patient outside of the X-Ray. The paper is structured as follows. In Section _ref_, we give some background on CheXNet . Section _ref_ explains our neural network architecture. Section _ref_ focuses on the experimental results and Section _ref_ offers a brief discussion.
