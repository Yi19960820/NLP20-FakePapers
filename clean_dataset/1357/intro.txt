Owing to its superb soft tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays serves as the major imaging modality in clinical practice. Real-time MRI visualization is of paramount importance for diagnostic and therapeutic guidance for instance in next generation platforms for MR-guided, minimally invasive neurosurgery~ _cite_ . However, the scan is quite slow, taking several minutes to acquire clinically acceptable images. This becomes more pronounced for high-resolution and volumetric images. As a result, the acquisition typically undergoes significant undersampling leading reconstruction to a seriously ill-posed linear inverse problem. To render it well-posed, the conventional compressed-sensing (CS) incorporates the prior image information by means of sparsity regularization in a proper transform domain such as Wavelet (WV), or, Total Variation (TV) ; see e.g., ~ _cite_ . This however demands running iterative optimization algorithms that are time and resource intensive. This in turn hinders {\it real-time} MRI visualization and analysis. Recently, a few attempts have been carried out to {\it automate} medical image reconstruction by leveraging historical patient data; see e.g., ~ _cite_ . They train a network that maps the aliased image to the gold-standard one using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with residuals for computed tomography (CT) ~ _cite_, denoising auto-encoders for MRI~ _cite_ . Albeit, speed up, they suffer from blurry and aliasing artifacts. This is mainly due to adopting a pixel-wise _inline_eq_ / _inline_eq_ cost that is oblivious of high-frequency texture details, which is crucial for drawing diagnostic decisions. See also the recent DeepADMM scheme in _cite_ for CS MRI that improves the quality, but it is as slow as the conventional CS. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been lately proved very successful in~ _cite_ modeling a low-dimensional distribution (manifold) of natural images that are perceptually appealing~ _cite_ . In particular, for image super-resolution tasks GANs achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality under _inline_eq_ upscaling factor for natural images e.g., from ImageNet~ _cite_ . GANs has also been deployed for image inpaitning~ _cite_, style transfer~ _cite_, and visual manipulation~ _cite_ . Despite the success of GANs for {\it local} image restoration such as super-resolution and inpainting, to date, they have not been studied for removing {\it aliasing} artifacts in biomedical image reconstruction tasks. This is indeed a more difficult image restoration tasks. In essence, aliasing artifacts (e.g., in MRI) emanate from data undersampling in a different domain (e.g., Fourier, projections) which {\it globally} impact image pixels. Inspired by the high texture quality offered by GANs, and the high contrast of MR images, we employ GANs to learn a low-dimensional manifold of diagnostic-quality MR images. To this end, we train a tandem network of a generator (G) and a discriminator (D), where the generator aims to generate the ground-truth images from the complex-valued aliased ones using a deep residual network (ResNet) with skip connections, with refinement to ensure it is consistent with measurement (data consistency) . The aliased input image is simply obtained via inverse Fourier Transform (FT) of undersampled data. D network then scores the G output, using a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) that scores one if the image is of diagnostic quality, and, zero if it contains artifacts. For training we adopt a mixture of LSGAN~ _cite_ and _inline_eq_ pixel-wise criterion to retrieve high-frequency texture while controlling the noise. We performed evaluations on a large cohort of pediatric patients with contrast-enhanced abdominal images. The retrieved images are rated by expert radiologists for diagnostic quality. Our observations indicate that GANCS results have almost similar quality to the gold-standard fully-sampled images, and are superior in terms of diagnostic quality relative to the existing alternatives including conventional CS (e.g., TV and WV), _inline_eq_-, and _inline_eq_-based criteria. Moreover, the reconstruction only takes around _inline_eq_ msec, that is two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art conventional CS toolboxes. Last but not least, the advocated GANCS scheme tailors inverse imaging tasks appearing in a wide range of applications with budgeted acquisition and reconstruction speed. All in all, relative to the past work this paper's main contributions are summarized as follows: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section N states the problem. Manifold learning using LSGANs is proposed in Section N. Section N also reports the data evaluations, while the conclusions are drawn in Section N.
