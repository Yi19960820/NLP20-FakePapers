\glsresetall Biometrics systems have significantly improved person identification and authentication, performing an important role in personal, national and global security~ _cite_ . In biometry, the iris appears as one of the main biological characteristics, since it remains unchanged over time and is unique for each person~ _cite_ . Furthermore, the identification process is non-invasive, in other words, there is no need of physical contact to obtain an iris image and analyze it~ _cite_ . Figure~ _ref_ illustrates the iris and other structures of a human eye. Iris location is usually the initial step in recognition, authentication and identification systems~ _cite_ and thus can directly affect their performance~ _cite_ . In this sense, how the iris location step influences those systems is an interesting question to be studied. For achieving such aim, here, we propose to benchmark/evaluate baseline methods that can be applied to iris location. Initially, we survey some methods in the literature. The pioneer and maybe the most well known methods for iris location is the one proposed by Daugman~ _cite_, which defines an integro-differential operator to identify the circular borders present in the images. This operator takes into account the circular shape of the iris in order to find the correct position, by maximizing the partial derivative with respect to the radius. Wildes~ _cite_ proposed another relevant method for iris location by using border detection and the Hough transform. First, the iris is isolated by using Gaussian filters of low pass followed by a spatial sub-sampling. Subsequently, the Hough transform is applied and those elements that better fit a circle according to a defined condition are selected. Tisse et al.~ _cite_, present a modification of Daugman's algorithm. This approach applies a Hough transform on a gradient decomposition to find an approximation of the pupil center. Then, the integro-differential operator is applied to locate the iris boundaries. It has the advantage of eliminating the errors caused by specular reflections. Rodr \'iguez \& Rubio~ _cite_ used two strategies to locate inner and outer iris contours. For locating the inner contour of the iris, the operator proposed by Daugman is used. Then, for determining the outer boundary of the iris, three points are detected, which represent the vertexes of a triangle inscribed in a circumference that models the iris boundary. This approach presented no better accuracy than the Daugman method, but makes full use of the local texture variation and does not use any optimization procedure. For this reason, it can reduce the computational cost~ _cite_ . Alvarez-Betancourt \& Garcia-Silvente _cite_ presented an iris location method based on the detection of circular boundaries under an approach of gradient analysis in points of interest of successive arcs. The quantified majority operator QMA-OWA~ _cite_ was used in order to obtain a representative value for each successive arc. The identification of the iris boundary is given by obtaining the arc with the greatest representative value. The authors reported similar results to those achieved by the Daugman method, with improvements in processing time. In the method proposed by ZhuYu \& Cui~ _cite_, the first step is to remove the eyelashes by dual-threshold method, which can be an advantage over other iris location approaches. Next, the facula is removed through erosion method. Finally, the accurate location is obtained through Hough Transform and least-squares method. Zhou et al.~ _cite_ presented a method for iris location based on Vector Field Convolution (VFC), which is used to estimate the initial location of the iris. This initial estimate makes pupil location much closer to the real boundary instead of circle fitting, improving location accuracy and reducing computational cost. The final result is obtained using the algorithm proposed by Daugman~ _cite_ . Zhang et al.~ _cite_ used an algorithm which adopts a momentum based level set method~ _cite_ to locate the pupil boundary. Finally, the Daugman's method was used in order to locate the iris. Determine the initial contour for momentum based level set by minimum average gray level method decreases the time consumption and improves the results obtained by the Daugman's method. This improvement happens because this initial contour, as well as the Zhou et al.~ _cite_ approach, is generally close to the real iris inner boundary~ _cite_ . Su et al.~ _cite_ proposed an iris location algorithm based on regional property and iterative searching. The pupil area is extracted using the regional attribute of the iris image, and the iris inner edge is fitted by iterating, comparing and sorting the pupil edge points. The outer edge location is completed in an iterative searching method on the basis of the extracted pupil centre and radius. As can be seen, several works in the literature have proposed methods to perform iris location by determining a circle that delimits it (as shown in red in Figure~ _ref_), since in many applications it is necessary to perform the iris normalization. Normalization consists in transforming the circular region of the iris from the Cartesian space into a polar coordinate system, so that the iris is represented by a rectangle. Usually, representations and characteristics used on further processes are extracted from the transformed image. In contrast, with the increasing success of deep learning techniques and \glspl* {cnn} in computer vision problems~ _cite_, it has become interesting also in iris-related biometrics problems (besides faces) the use of the entire iris region, including the pupil and some sclera region, without the need for normalization. In this sense, this work defines the iris location task as the determination of the smallest squared bounding box that encompasses the entire region of the iris as show in yellow in Figure~ _ref_ . Thus we propose to evaluate, as baselines, the following window-based detectors: N) a sliding window detector based on features from \gls* {hog} and a linear \gls* {svm} classifier, i.e., an adaptation from the human detection method proposed by Dalal \& Triggs~ _cite_ ; N) a deep learning based detector fine-tuned from YOLO object detector~ _cite_ . We compare our results with the well-known method of Daugman~ _cite_, since its notoriety and one fair implementation can be publicly found . The experiments were performed in six databases and the reported results show that the use of deep learning to iris location is promising. The fine-tuned model from YOLO object detector yielded real-time location with high accuracy, overcoming problems such as noise, eyelids, eyelashes and reflections. This paper is structured as follows: Section~ _ref_ presents the databases used in the experiments; Section~ _ref_ describes the baseline methods used in this work; Section~ _ref_ reports our experiments and discusses our results; Finally, Section~ _ref_ concludes the work.
