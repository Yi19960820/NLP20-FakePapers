Source camera identification is the process of determining which camera or model has been used to capture an image. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of research interest in the domain of forensics. In the current work, we describe our Deep Learning approach to the camera detection task of N cameras as a part of the Camera Model Identification Challenge hosted by Kaggle.com where our team finished Nnd out of N teams with the accuracy on the unseen data of N \%. Augmentations that allowed a stay robust against transformations. A number of experiments are carried out on datasets collected by organizers and scraped from the web.
