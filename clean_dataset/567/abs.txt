Minutiae play a major role in fingerprint identification. Extracting reliable minutiae is difficult for latent fingerprints which are usually of poor quality. As the limitation of traditional handcrafted features, a fully convolutional network (FCN) is utilized to learn features directly from data to overcome complex background noises. Raw fingerprints are mapped to a correspondingly-sized minutia-score map with a fixed stride. And thus a large number of minutiae will be extracted through a given threshold. Then small regions centering at these minutia points are entered into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reclassify these minutiae and calculate their orientations. The CNN shares convolutional layers with the fully convolutional network to speed up. N second is used on average to detect one fingerprint on a GPU. On the NIST SDN database, we achieve N \% recall rate and N \% precise rate that outperform many other algorithms. Our trained model is also visualized to show that we have successfully extracted features preserving ridge information of a latent fingerprint.
