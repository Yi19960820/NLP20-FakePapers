Despite the increasing availability of digital books in the modern age of information, many people still favor reading physical books. The large libraries that house them require great amount of time and labor to manage inventories that number in the millions. Manually searching bookshelves is time-consuming and often not fruitful depending on how vague the search is. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based scene text reading system that can viably solve this problem. Our work has two goals: N) build a book inventory from only the images of bookshelves; N) help users quickly locate the book they are looking for. Once the book is identified, additional stored information could also be retrieved, e.g. a short description of the book. The intent of this work is to make what was previously a tedious experience (i.e., searching books in bookshelves) much more user-friendly, especially for visually impaired people. In addition, our system also offers the potential for efficiently building a large database of book collections. The full pipeline of our system is summarized in Figure _ref_ .
