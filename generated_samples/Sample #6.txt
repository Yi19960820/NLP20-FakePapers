<|startoftext|> We propose a method based on deep learning to perform cardiac segmentation on short axis MRI image stacks iteratively from the top slice (around the base) to the bottom slice (around the apex) . At each iteration, a novel variant of U-net is applied to propagate the segmentation of a slice to the adjacent slice below it. In other words, the prediction of a segmentation of a slice is dependent upon the already existing segmentation of an adjacent slice. ND-consistency is hence explicitly enforced. The method is trained on a large database of N cases from UK Biobank. It is then tested on N different cases from UK Biobank and three other state-of-the-art cohorts (ACDC with N cases, Sunnybrook with N cases, RVSC with N cases) . Results comparable or even better than the state-of-the-art in terms of distance measures are achieved. They also emphasize the assets of our method, namely enhanced spatial consistency (currently neither considered nor achieved by the state-of-the-art), and the generalization ability to unseen cases even from other databases. <|endoftext|>
 
 
  <|startoftext|> We want to make sure that every patient in the world has access to the most basic and essential healthcare information, which is vital to the health and well-being of all of our people. The health and well-being of the people living with cancer, heart disease and diabetes are among the most important factors that contribute to the overall health and well-being of the people living with cancer. Therefore, we propose a method to perform cardiac segmentation on short-to-bottom MRI stacks (i.e., the bottom-slice) of healthy subjects in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the disease status and its potential for treatment. In particular, we want to provide a comprehensive assessment of the disease status of patients at the bottom of the stack, as well as the potential for treatment. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as a) We present a method to perform segmentation on a large database (N, N cases) from UK Biobank, which contains approximately N, N cases, with N different diagnoses and N different types of disease (e.g., cancer, heart disease and diabetes). b) We present a method to perform a segmentation on the bottom-slice of a large dataset of N cases from UK Biobank, which contains approximately N, N cases, with N different diagnoses and N different types of disease (e.g., cancer, heart disease and diabetes). c) Our method is evaluated on a large database of N cases from UK Biobank, which contains approximately N, N cases, with N different diagnoses and N different types of diseases.<|endoftext|>
