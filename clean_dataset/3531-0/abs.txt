We present ongoing work to harness biological approaches to achieving highly efficient egocentric perception by combining the space-variant imaging architecture of the mammalian retina with Deep Learning methods. By pre-processing images collected by means of eye-tracking glasses to control the fixation locations of a software retina model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the input to a DCNN by a factor of N, reduce the required number of training epochs and obtain over N \% classification rates when training and validating the system on a database of over N, N images of N object classes.
