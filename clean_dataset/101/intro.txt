Lung nodule classification is a class imbalanced problem because nodules are found with much lower frequency than non-nodules. In the class imbalanced problem, conventional classifiers tend to be overwhelmed by the majority class and ignore the minority class. As one method to cope with the class imbalanced problem in lung nodule classification, we proposed cascaded convolutional neural networks that perform as single-sided classifiers for filtering out obvious non-nodules such as blood vessels or ribs _cite_ . The method can achieve a few false positives while maintaining high sensitivity in the lung nodule classification. In this paper, we propose Fusion classifier that is a deep neural network to fuse the output of multiple models. To fuse models, nodule probabilities are calculated by using convolutional neural network models. Then, Fusion classifier is trained and tested by the nodule probabilities. Finally, an output of Fusion classifier is a nodule probability of the nodule candidate. The proposed method achieved a few false positives while maintaining higher sensitivity than using cascaded neural networks solely.
