Currently, about one-quarter of the worldâ€™s urban population live in slums _cite_ . These slum residents lack basic resources such as clean water, proper sanitation, electricity, and other necessary basic services. Various initiatives have been undertaken by international organizations and world governments in the past few decades towards slum improvement and rehabilitation. These initiatives rely heavily on the information provided by slum mapping and monitoring, such as scale, boundaries and slum growth, crucial for slum policy planning and development. Thus it is essential to have automated, robust, and efficient methods for slum mapping and monitoring. Slums differ greatly in terms of shape and appearance. Current approaches to slum segmentation and change detection are limited and do not adapt very well to the variance in shape and texture. In addition, these approaches classify all detected instances of slums as one entity, given a satellite image, and do not recognize individual slums in a satellite image, which is essential for developing rehabilitation strategies for individual slums. We concentrate our work on the slums in Mumbai--Dharavi, The Mankhurd-Govandi belt, Kurla-Ghatkopar belt, Dindoshi and The Bhandup-Mulund slums. The number of slum-dwellers in Mumbai is estimated to be around N million, up from N million in N that is, N \% of of Mumbai live in informal slums . In our work we introduce the following contributions: We show that our method effectively identifies individual slums and demonstrates good qualitative and quantitative results.
