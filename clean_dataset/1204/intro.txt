Monitoring the quality of inland waters is a major research topic in many scopes of environmental applications. Traditionally, a water body is monitored with several point-based in-situ measurements. Although, the data measured at such specific points is precise, these measurement techniques are time consuming when covering a large area. Additionally, if area-wide information is required, the data needs to be interpolated as well. Regarding the demand for area-wide information of water parameters, hyperspectral sensing seems to close the gap left behind by in-situ point-measurements. The spectral signature of natural water bodies is mainly characterized by absorption and scattering on four water parameters: chlorophyll~ a, suspended solids, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and turbidity~ _cite_ . Chlorophyll~ a is a pigment which functions as an indicator for algae existence and nutrition supply in water bodies. Turbidity is influenced by algae concentrations and suspended particles. CDOM is a natural degradation product group of organic materials which is natural in waters. It is also affected by human impacts like sewage treatment plants. Recent approaches were made to estimate chlorophyll~ a concentration, CDOM content and turbidity with hyperspectral data. As described in~ _cite_, the spectral signature of chlorophyll~ a in water is characterized by a reflectance minimum at about as well as reflectance maxima in the green and red spectral range. The distinction of algae species based on their measured hyperspectral signature was studied e.g. in a laboratory~ _cite_ . With increasing CDOM content, the absorption simultaneously increases in shorter wavelengths~ _cite_ . Estimations of water parameters with hyperspectral data mostly rely on empirical approaches. Centerpiece of these approaches is, on the one hand, the selection of reflectance bands including single bands, band ratios and multiple band algorithms~ _cite_ . On the other hand, further studies consider the area between {\nano \meter} under the related maximum~ _cite_ or the maximum itself~ _cite_ for the estimation of chlorophyll~ a concentration. In addition, derivatives of the spectra up to the fourth grade are applied~ _cite_ . Machine learning approaches to estimate CDOM and are applied yet solely in few studies. The former is estimated with e.g. functional linear models~ _cite_ or linear stepwise regression~ _cite_ . Currently, random forests are applied to estimate the latter~ _cite_ . In general, machine learning models require sufficient input data to solve a non-linear regression problem with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we proceed to examine the potential of supervised machine learning approaches to estimate crucial water parameters such as chlorophyll~ a, green algae, diatoms, CDOM, and turbidity. We rely on a dataset which was measured on the German part of the River Elbe under real-world conditions. Precise monitoring of the water parameters followed by hyperspectral snapshots and in-situ probe measurements were conducted. As a remark, a first impression and a description of the dataset is given in~ _cite_ . The major contributions of this paper are: We briefly describe the dataset used for the estimation of water parameters based on the introduced regression framework in . The presentation of the methodology follows in . We assess the regression performance of the five machine learning models in . Finally, we briefly conclude our studies in .
