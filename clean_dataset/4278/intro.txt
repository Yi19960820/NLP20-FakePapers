As a canonical case of general object detection problem, in the past decades, pedestrian detection has attracted consistent attention from computer vision community~ _cite_ . It is the principle technique for various applications, such as surveillance, tracking, autonomous driving, etc. Although numerous efforts have been made for this problem and significant improvement has been achieved in recent years~ _cite_, there still exists an insurmountable gap between current machine intelligence and human perception ability on pedestrian detection~ _cite_ . Many challenges prevent artificial vision systems from practical applications, including occlusion, low image resolution, and cluttered background. Besides, since most of current pedestrian detectors explored color images of good lighting, they are very likely to be stuck with images captured at night, due to bad visibility of pedestrians. Such defect would cut these approaches off from the around-the-clock applications, \eg, self-driven car and surveillance system. In fact, aforementioned difficulties not only exist in pedestrian detection, but also in many other vision tasks. To tackle these problems, other types of sensors beyond RGB cameras were developed, such as depth cameras (time-of-flight, or near infrared, \eg, Kinect) and thermal cameras (long-wavelength infrared) . Since ambient lighting has less effect on thermal imaging, thermal cameras are widely used in human tracking~ _cite_, face recognition~ _cite_, and activity recognition~ _cite_ for its robustness. With regard to pedestrian detection, thermal images usually present clear silhouettes of human objects~ _cite_, but lose fine visual details of human objects (\eg, clothing) which can be captured by RGB cameras (depending on external illumination) . As shown in Figure~ _ref_, instances of yellow bounding boxes would fail in detection with one image channel (color or thermal), while the other might help. In some sense, color and thermal image channels provide complementary visual information. Nevertheless, except very recent effort~ _cite_, most of previous studies focus on detecting pedestrians with color or thermal images only, rather than leveraging color and thermal images simultaneously. Furthermore, although researchers have applied deep neural networks (DNNs) on vision problems with multimodal data sources, \eg, action recognition~ _cite_, image classification~ _cite_, etc., it is still unknown how color and thermal image channels can be properly fused in DNNs to achieve the best pedestrian detection synergy. In this paper, we focus on how to make the most of multispectral images (color and thermal) for pedestrian detection. With the recent success of DNNs~ _cite_ on generic object detection~ _cite_, it becomes very natural and interesting to exploit the effectiveness of DNNs for multispectral pedestrian detection. We first adapt Faster R-CNN~ _cite_ model into our vanilla convolutional network (ConvNet), and train two separate pedestrian detectors on color or thermal images, respectively. It is not surprising to discover that these two ConvNet-based detectors provide complementary detection decisions, and there is a large potential to improve the detection performance by leveraging multispectral images, especially for around-the-clock applications. However, it is not trivial to explore the most effective DNNs architecture that simultaneously utilizes color and thermal images for pedestrian detection. Then the challenge of multispectral pedestrian detection task becomes a ConvNet fusion problem. From the perspective of fusions on different DNNs levels, four ConvNet fusion architectures are carefully designed upon our vanilla ConvNet, and then well investigated with extensive experimental evaluation. Our major contribution is fourfold:
