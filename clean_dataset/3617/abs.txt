Facial recognition has always been a challenging task for computer vision scientists and experts. Despite complexities arising due to variations in camera parameters, illumination and face orientations, significant progress has been made in the field with deep learning algorithms now competing with human-level accuracy. But in contrast to the recent advances in face recognition techniques, Disguised Facial Identification continues to be a tougher challenge in the field of computer vision. The modern day scenario, where security is of prime concern, regular face identification techniques do not perform as required when the faces are disguised, which calls for a different approach to handle situations where intruders have their faces masked. Along the same lines, we propose a deep learning architecture for disguised facial recognition (DFR) . The algorithm put forward in this paper detects N facial key-points in the first stage, using a N-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) . These facial key-points are later utilized by a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying the disguised faces based on the euclidean distance ratios and angles between different facial key-points. This overall architecture imparts a basic intelligence to our system. Our key-point feature prediction accuracy is N \% while the classification rate is N \%. Moreover, the architecture works at N FPS, thereby performing in almost real-time. The efficiency of our approach is also compared with the state-of-the-art Disguised Facial Identification methods.
