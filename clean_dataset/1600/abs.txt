A novel hierarchical model is introduced to solve a general problem of detecting groups of similar objects. Under this model, detection of groups is performed in hierarchically organized layers while each layer represents a scope for target objects. The processing of these layers involves sequential extraction of appearance features for an individual object, consistency measurement features for nearby objects, and finally the distribution features for all objects within the group. Using the concept of scope-based normalization, the extracted features not only enhance local contrast of an individual object, but also provide consistent characterization for all related objects. As an example, a microcalcification group detection system for ND mammography was developed, and then the learned model was transferred to ND digital breast tomosynthesis without any retraining or fine-tuning. The detection system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and detected _inline_eq_ of cancerous lesions at the rate of _inline_eq_ false positives per volume as measured on an independent tomosynthesis test set.
