\vspace* {-N} Face detection, the task of predicting where faces are located in an image, is one of the most well-studied problems in computer vision, since it represents a prerequisite for many other tasks such as face recognition~ _cite_, facial expression recognition~ _cite_, age estimation, gender classification and so on. Inspired by the recent advances in deep object detection~ _cite_, researchers have proposed very deep neural networks~ _cite_ as a solution to the face detection task, providing significant accuracy improvements. Although deep models~ _cite_ generally offer better results than shallow~ _cite_ or handcrafted models~ _cite_, their complex architectures come with more computational requirements and slower inference speeds. As an alternative for environments with limited resources, e.g. mobile devices, researchers have proposed shallower neural networks~ _cite_ that provide fast but less accurate results. In this context, we believe it is relevant to propose and evaluate an approach that allows to set the trade-off between accuracy and speed in face detection on a continuous scale. Based on the same principles described in~ _cite_, we hypothesize that using more complex and accurate face detectors for images and less complex and fast face detectors for images will provide an optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed, without ever having to change anything about the face detectors. The only problem that prevents us from testing our hypothesis in practice is finding an approach to classify the images into easy or hard. In order to be useful in practice, the approach also has to work fast enough, e.g. at least as fast as the faster face detector. To this end, we propose and evaluate five simple and straightforward approaches to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed in face detection. All the approaches are based on separating the test images in two batches, an batch that is fed to the faster face detector and a (or) batch that is fed to the more accurate face detector. The difference between the five approaches is the criterion used for splitting the images in two batches. The first approach assigns a test image to the easy or the hard batch based on the class-agnostic image difficulty score, which is estimated using a recent approach for image difficulty prediction introduced by Ionescu et al.~ _cite_ . The image difficulty predictor is obtained by training a deep neural network to regress on the difficulty scores produced by human annotators. The second approach is based on a person-aware image difficulty predictor, which is trained only on images containing the class . The other three approaches used for splitting the test images (into easy or hard) employ a faster single-shot face detector, namely MobileNet-SSD~ _cite_, in order estimate the number of faces and each of their sizes. The third and the fourth approaches independently consider the number of detected faces (images with less faces go into the easy batch) and the average size of the faces (images with bigger faces go into the easy batch), while the fifth approach is based on the number of faces divided by their average size (images with less and bigger faces go into the easy batch) . If one of the latter three approaches classifies an image as easy, there is nothing left to do (we can directly return the detections provided by MobileNet-SSD) . Our experiments on the AFW~ _cite_ and the FDDB~ _cite_ data sets show that using the class-agnostic or person-aware image difficulty as a primary cue for splitting the test images compares favorably to a random split of the images. However, the other three approaches, which are frustratingly easy to implement, can also produce good results. Among the five proposed methods, the best results are obtained by the class-agnostic image difficulty predictor. This approach shortens the processing time nearly by half, while reducing the Average Precision of the Single Shot Scale-invariant Face Detector (S _inline_eq_ FD) ~ _cite_ from _inline_eq_ to no less than _inline_eq_ on AFW. Moreover, all our methods are simple and have the advantage that they allow us to choose the desired trade-off on a continuous scale. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
