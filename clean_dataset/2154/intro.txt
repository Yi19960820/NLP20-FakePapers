Given a set of pedestrian images, person re-identification aims to identify the probe image that generally captured by different cameras. Nowadays, person re-identification becomes increasingly important for surveillance and security system, replacing manual video screening and other heavy loads. Person re-identification is a challenging task due to large variations of body pose, lighting, view angles, scenarios across time and cameras. The framework of existing methods usually consists of two parts: (N) extracting discriminative features from pedestrian images; (N) computing the distance of samples by feature comparison. There are many works focus on these two aspects. The traditional methods work at improving suitable hand-crafted features~ _cite_, or good metric for comparison~ _cite_, or both of them~ _cite_ . The first aspect considers to find features that are robust to challenging factors (lighting, pose) while preserving the identity information. The second aspect comes to the metric learning problem which generally minimizes the intra-class distance while maximizing the inter-class distance. More recently, the deep learning methods gradually gain the popularity in person re-identification. The re-identification methods by deep learning~ _cite_ incorporate the two above-mentioned aspects (feature extraction and metric learning) of person re-identification into an integrated framework. The feature extraction and the metric learning are fulfilled respectively by two components in a deep neural network: the CNN part which extracts features from images, and the following metric learning part which compares the features with the metric. The FPNN~ _cite_ algorithm introduced a patch matching layer for the CNN part for the first time. Ahmed ~ _cite_ proposed an improved deep learning architecture (IDLA) with cross-input neighborhood differences and patch summary features. These two methods are both dedicated to improve the CNN architecture. Their purpose is to evaluate the pair similarity early in the CNN stage, so that it could make use of spatial correspondence of feature maps. As for the metric learning part, DML~ _cite_ adopted the cosine similarity and Binomial deviance. DeepFeature~ _cite_ adopted the Euclidean distance and triplet loss. Some others~ _cite_ used the logistic loss to directly form a binary classification problem of whether the input image pair belongs to the same identity. The following are our contributions.
