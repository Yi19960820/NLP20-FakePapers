Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used for image recognition with great success. However, there are a number of limitations of the current CNN based image recognition paradigm. First, the receptive field of CNN is generally fixed, which limits its recognition capacity when the input image is very large. Second, it lacks the computational scalability for dealing with images with different sizes. Third, it is quite different from human visual system for image recognition, which involves both feadforward and recurrent proprocessing. This paper proposes a different paradigm of image recognition, which can take advantages of variable scales of the input images, has more computational scalabilities, and is more similar to image recognition by human visual system. It is based on recurrent neural network (RNN) defined on image scale with an embeded base CNN, which is named Scale Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) . This RNN based approach makes it easier to deal with images with variable sizes, and allows us to borrow existing RNN techniques, such as LSTM and GRU, to further enhance the recognition accuracy. Our experiments show that the recognition accuracy of a base CNN can be significantly boosted using the proposed SRNN models. It also significantly outperforms the scale ensemble method, which integrate the results of performing CNN to the input image at different scales, although the computational overhead of using SRNN is negligible.
