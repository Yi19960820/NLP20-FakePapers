Radon transform is widely used in physical and life sciences and one of its major applications is the X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT), which is significant in modern health examination. The Radon inversion or image reconstruction is challenging due to the potentially defective radon projections. Conventionally, the reconstruction process contains several stages to approximate the corresponding Radon inversion. Each of the stages is highly dependent on the results of the previous stage. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework for Radon inversion via deep learning (DL) . The Radon inversion can be approximated by the proposed framework with an end-to-end fashion instead of processing step-by-step with multiple stages. For simplicity, the proposed framework is short as iRadonMap (i nverse Radon transfor m ap proximation) . Specifically, we implement the iRadonMap as an appropriative neural network, of which the architecture can be divided into two segments. In the first segment, a learnable fully-connected filtering layer is used to filter the radon projections along the view-angle direction, which is followed by a learnable sinusoidal back-projection layer to transfer the filtered radon projections into an image. The second segment is a common neural network architecture to further improve the reconstruction performance in the image domain. The iRadonMap is overall optimized by training a large number of generic images from ImageNet database. To evaluate the performance of the iRadonMap, clinical patient data is used. Qualitative results show promising reconstruction performance of the iRadonMap.
