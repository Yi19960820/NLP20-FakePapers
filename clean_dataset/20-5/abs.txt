A class of specialized neurons, called lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) has been shown to respond strongly to wide-field motion. The classic model, elementary motion detector (EMD) and its improved model, two-quadrant detector (TQD) have been proposed to simulate LPTCs. Although EMD and TQD can percept background motion, their outputs are so cluttered that it is difficult to discriminate actual motion direction of the background. In this paper, we propose a max operation mechanism to model a newly-found transmedullary neuron TmN whose physiological properties do not map onto EMD and TQD. This proposed max operation mechanism is able to improve the detection performance of TQD in cluttered background by filtering out irrelevant motion signals. We will demonstrate the functionality of this proposed mechanism in wide-field motion perception.
