With this paper we present our ongoing work on exploring a spectrum of graph convolutional networks that addresses some of the shortcomings of GCNs as introduced in the context of graph convolutional learning~ _cite_ . We provide some background on graph convolutional networks, and explore GCNs with the help of computation graphs. We then introduce a novel way to generalize GCNs. This is done by clustering the neighborhood of each node into exactly _inline_eq_ components. Each of these components determines the nodes whose attribute values are aggregated into a _inline_eq_-dimensional vector. This introduces more complex feature maps and we can show that for regular graphs the method is as expressive as standard ND convolutional networks. At the same time, we can show that the GCN as introduced by Kipf \& Welling and the MoNet framework are special instances of the proposed approach where the attribute values of all nodes in the N-hop neighborhood are average pooled based on global node degree information. The limitations of GCNs as introduced by Kipf \& Welling on regular graphs, that is, graphs with a regular neighborhood connectivity such as grid graphs, have been explored before . Our motivation is an exploration of generalizations of GCNs. Since this is a paper describing ongoing work, we do not provide experimental results. We state, however, some results on the expressivity of the method and its relationship to existing approaches. We also believe that the discussion of GCNs in terms of computation graphs is helpful for understanding GCNs and their relation to other graph-based convolutional network approaches which perform an ordering operation in node neighborhoods~ _cite_ .
