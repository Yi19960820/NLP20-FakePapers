This paper describes our submission to the Nst ND Face Alignment in the Wild (NDFAW) Challenge. Our method builds upon the idea of convolutional part heatmap regression _cite_, extending it for ND face alignment. Our method decomposes the problem into two parts: (a) X, Y (ND) estimation and (b) Z (depth) estimation. At the first stage, our method estimates the X, Y coordinates of the facial landmarks by producing a set of ND heatmaps, one for each landmark, using convolutional part heatmap regression. Then, these heatmaps, alongside the input RGB image, are used as input to a very deep subnetwork trained via residual learning for regressing the Z coordinate. Our method ranked Nst in the NDFAW Challenge, surpassing the second best result by more than N \%. Code can be found at _url_
