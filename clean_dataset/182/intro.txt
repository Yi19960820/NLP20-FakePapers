According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, breast cancer accounts for _inline_eq_ of invasive cancers and _inline_eq_ of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide . In the U.S., _inline_eq_ in _inline_eq_ women is expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime _cite_ . Routine mammography is standard for preventive care and detection of breast cancer before biopsy. However, it is still a manual process, prone to human error due to high variability in mass appearance _cite_ and low signal-to-noise ratio, and thus can cause unnecessary biopsies or worse, missed malignant masses. Furthermore, efficacy is often highly correlated with radiologist expertise and workload _cite_ . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved impressive results on computer visions tasks spanning classification _cite_, object detection _cite_, and segmentation _cite_ . For breast mass diagnosis, deep learning techniques have been explored _cite_, but never in a fully end-to-end manner (directly classifying from pixel space) because of the scarcity of available data and lack of interpretability. In this work, we successfully train end-to-end CNN architectures to directly classify breast masses as benign or malignant. We obtain state-of-the-art results using a combination of transfer learning, careful pre-processing and data augmentation. We analyze the effects of these modelling choices and furthermore show how we can provide interpretability to the model's predictions.
