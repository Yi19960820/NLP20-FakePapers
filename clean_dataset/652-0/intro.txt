detection plays an important role in many computer vision applications (e.g., video surveillance and driving assistance) . Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (i.e., CNN) based methods have greatly promoted the progress of pedestrian detection _cite_ . To better deal with scale-variance problem of pedestrian detection, multi-scale methods based on CNN have been proposed _cite_ . These methods can be mainly divided into two classes: (N) image pyramid based methods and (N) feature pyramid based methods. Image pyramid based methods _cite_ usually re-sample the input image into different scales and then put these rescaled images into the trained network, respectively. Thus, these methods are time-consuming. Instead of resampling the input image, feature pyramid based methods _cite_ use the convolutional layers of different spatial resolutions to detect pedestrians of different scales. Compared to image pyramid based methods, feature pyramid based methods make better use of features from different convolutional layers and have faster detection speed. Thus, feature pyramid based methods become more popular. Fig. _ref_ shows the architectures of some typical feature pyramid based methods. MSCNN _cite_ in Fig. _ref_ (a) uses the in-network layers of different spatial resolutions to generate the candidate proposals of different scales. SSD _cite_ adopts the similar strategy for object detection. However, the maps from different layers have features of different semantic levels. To solve this problem, FPN _cite_ and RON _cite_ in Fig. _ref_ (b) adopt top-down structure to combine the low-resolution but high-level semantic map with the high-resolution but low-level semantic map. Compared to MSCNN _cite_, these methods generate a feature pyramid where all the maps have relatively high-level semantic features. Despite the success, we argue that the features of combined map are not deep enough. To further improve detection performance, we propose a multi-branch and high-level semantic convolutional neural network (called basic MHN in Fig. _ref_ (c)) . The base network in basic MHN (i.e., MHN-noskip) is gradually split into multiple branches before different pooling layers. Thus, all branches have the same depth, and the output maps from different branches have similarly high-level semantic features. Meanwhile, different branches have different spatial resolutions and different receptive fields, which are suitable to detect pedestrians of different scales. Moreover, MHN is generated by skip-layer connections where the high-resolution but small receptive field map is enhanced with context information by the low-resolution but large receptive field map. Because dilated convolution can retain more spatial information, it is also incorporated into part branches of MHN (i.e., MHN-D) . Finally, the weighted scores of proposal generation network (RPN) and proposal classification network (Fast RCNN) are proposed when they are embedded into Faster RCNN architecture _cite_ . The contributions and merits of this paper can be summarized as follows. (N) A multi-branch and high-level semantic convolutional neural network (MHN-noskip) is proposed for multi-scale pedestrian detection. All branches have same depth, and the output maps of different branches have similarly high-level semantic features. (N) Context information is introduced in MHN by skip-layer connection between the high-resolution but small receptive field map and the low-resolution but large receptive field map. Meanwhile, based on dilated convolution, the output maps in MHN-D can retain more spatial information. (N) When MHN and MHN-D are embedded into Faster RCNN architecture, the weighted scores of RPN and Fast RCNN are proposed for pedestrian detection, which is very simple and effective. (N) Experiments are conducted on three public pedestrian datasets (i.e., Caltech _cite_, KITTI _cite_, and Citypersons _cite_), which demonstrate that the proposed methods have better performance than other feature pyramid methods (e.g., MSCNN _cite_ and FPN _cite_) . Moreover, experiments on very challenging COCO benchmark _cite_ demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully applied to general object detection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. _ref_ will review some related works of pedestrian detection. Sec. _ref_ introduces our proposed method. Experimental results will be shown in Sec. _ref_ . Sec. _ref_ concludes this paper.
