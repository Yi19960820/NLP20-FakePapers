Pores, which constitute the extended fingerprint features, are generally observable in high-resolution fingerprint images _cite_ . The effectiveness of pore features for high-resolution fingerprint based biometric recognition has been explored and the features have been found to carry sufficient discriminating power. They have also been shown to be effective for recognition using partial fingerprint images, which may not contain sufficient level-N features _cite_ . Studies _cite_ have also shown that the fusion of pore and level-N features leads to enhanced recognition performance. However, it is imperative that the pore coordinates are detected accurately. The existing pore detection techniques can be broadly classified into feature-based techniques _cite_ and learning-based techniques _cite_ . Since deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for various computer vision tasks, researchers have focused on designing learning-based techniques for detecting pores in high-resolution fingerprint images. Table _ref_ presents a summary of such techniques. Labati _cite_ developed an approach for pore detection that employs a shallow CNN to generate a pore intensity map, which is thresholded to obtain the pore coordinates. Their approach _cite_, however, does not provide any improvement over the existing feature-based pore detection techniques. Recently, Jang _cite_ presented a pore detection technique using a deep CNN that consists of N learnable layers. The pore intensity map generated by their network is processed to detect the pore coordinates. Their approach _cite_ provides a considerable improvement in pore detection accuracy over the existing approaches. However, DeepPore network presented in _cite_ has a plain CNN architecture with only N learnable layers. Furthermore, their approach has been evaluated on a very small test set containing only N fingerprint images. The contribution of this work is a residual learning _cite_ based CNN, referred to as DeepResPore, for detecting pores in high-resolution fingerprint images. Specifically, we have designed an N-layer network containing N residual blocks inspired by ResNets _cite_ . The proposed network has been trained on a large labeled dataset containing N, N patches and evaluated on multiple test sets to ascertain its performance.
