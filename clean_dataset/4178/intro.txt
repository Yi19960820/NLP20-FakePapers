Semantic segmentation refers to the problem of labeling every pixel in an image with the correct semantic category. Handling the immense variability in the appearance of semantic categories requires the use of context to achieve human-level accuracy, as shown, for example, by _cite_ . Specifically, _cite_ found that human performance in labeling a super-pixel is worse than a computer when both have access to that super-pixel only. Effectively using context presents a significant challenge, especially when a solution is required. An elegant deep recursive neural network approach for semantic segmentation was proposed in _cite_, referred to as RCPN. The main idea was to facilitate the propagation of contextual information from each super-pixel to every other super-pixel through random binary parse trees. First, a {\em semantic mapper} mapped visual features of the super-pixels into a semantic space. This was followed by a recursive combination of semantic features of two adjacent image regions, using a, to yield the holistic feature vector of the entire image, termed the root feature. Next, the global information contained in the root feature was disseminated to every super-pixel in the image, using a, followed by classification of each super-pixel via a . The parameters were learned by minimizing the classification loss of the super-pixels by back-propagation through structure _cite_ . RCPN was shown to outperform recent approaches in terms of per-pixel accuracy (PPA) and mean-class accuracy (MCA) . Most interestingly, it was almost two orders of magnitude faster than competing algorithms. RCPN's speed and state-of-the-art performance motivate us to carefully analyze it. In this paper we show that it still has some weaknesses and we show how to remedy them. In particular, the direct path from the semantic mapper to the categorizer gives rise to bypass errors that can cause RCPN to bypass the combiner and decombiner assembly. This can cause back-propogation to reduce RCPN to a simple multi-layer neural network for each super-pixel. We propose modifications to RCPN that overcome this problem The resulting architectures provide promising improvements over the previous state-of-the-art on three semantic segmentation datasets: Stanford background _cite_, SIFT flow _cite_ and Daimler urban _cite_ . The next section describes some of the related works followed by a brief overview of RCPN in Sec.~ _ref_ . We describe our proposed methods in Sec.~ _ref_ followed by experiments in Sec.~ _ref_ . Finally, we conclude in Sec.~ _ref_ .
