Person recognition aims at recognizing the same identity across time and space with complicated scenes and similar appearance. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this task by training a network to obtain robust and representative features. Our method also differs from previous work in person recognition that we do not conduct a second training on the test subset. The identity of a person is determined by measuring the similarity from several body regions in the reference set. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better classification accuracy against previous state-of-the-arts.
