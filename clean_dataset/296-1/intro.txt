The rate of criminal activities by individuals and threats by terrorist groups has been on the rise in recent years. The law enforcement agencies have been motivated to use video surveillance systems to monitor and curb these threats. Many automated video surveillance systems have been developed in the past to monitor abandoned objects (bags) ~ _cite_, theft~ _cite_, fire or smoke~ _cite_, violent activities~ _cite_, etc. Li et al.~ _cite_ developed a video surveillance system to identify the abandoned objects with the use of Gaussian mixture models and Support Vector Machine. This system is robust to illumination changes and performs with an accuracy of N \%. This system is vital for the detection of abandon bags in busy public areas, which may contain bombs. Chuang et al.~ _cite_ used Forward-backward ratio histogram and a finite state machine to recognize robberies. This system has proven to be very useful around automatic teller machines (ATMs) and has detected N \% cases of the theft. Seebamrungsat et al.~ _cite_ presented a fire detection system based on HSV and YCbCr color models as it allowed it to distinguish bright images more efficiently than other RGB models. The system has been shown to detect fire with an accuracy of more than N \%. Goya et al.~ _cite_ introduced a Public Safety System (PSS) for identifying criminal actions such as purse snatching, child kidnapping, and fighting using distance, velocity, and area to determine the human behavior. This system can identify the criminal actions with an accuracy of around N \%. These reported systems have been very successful in detecting and reporting various criminal activities. Despite their impressive performance (more than N \% accuracy), the area these systems can monitor is limited due to the restricted field of view of the cameras. The law enforcement agencies have been motivated to use aerial surveillance systems to surveil large areas. Governments have recently deployed drones in war zones to monitor hostiles, to spy on foreign drug cartels~ _cite_, conducting border control operations~ _cite_ as well as finding criminal activity in urban and rural areas~ _cite_ . One or more soldiers pilot most of these drones for long durations which makes these systems prone to mistakes due to the human fatigue. Surya et al.~ _cite_ proposed an autonomous drone surveillance system capable of detecting individuals engaged in violent activities in public areas. This first of its kind system used the deformable parts model~ _cite_ to estimate human poses which are then used to identify the suspicious individuals. This is an extremely challenging task as the images or videos recorded by the drone can suffer from illumination changes, shadows, poor resolution, and blurring. Also, the humans can appear at different locations, orientations, and scales. Despite the above-explained complications, the system can detect violent activated with an accuracy of around N \% which is far less as compared to the greater than N \% performance of the ground surveillance systems. This paper introduces an improved real-time autonomous drone surveillance system to identify violent individuals in public areas. The proposed method first uses the feature pyramid network (FPN) ~ _cite_ is used to detect the humans from the aerial image. Next, the proposed ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (SHDL) network is used to estimate the pose for each detected human. Finally, the orientations between the limbs of the estimated pose are used by the support vector machine (SVM) to identify individuals engaged in violent activities. The novelties of the proposed system and the advantages over Surya et al.'s~ _cite_ technique are detailed below: The proposed Drone Surveillance System (DSS) is used to identify the individuals engaged in violent activities from aerial images. The pose estimation and activity classification performance of the system is compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. The paper is divided into the following sections. Section N presents the introduced AVI dataset while Section N introduces the proposed DSS system. Section N details the experimental results and Section N concludes this research.
