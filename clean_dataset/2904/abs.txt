In this paper, we propose a structured image inpainting method employing an energy based model. In order to learn structural relationship between patterns observed in images and missing regions of the images, we employ an energy-based structured prediction method. The structural relationship is learned by minimizing an energy function which is defined by a simple convolutional neural network. The experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods which use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) . We obtained N mean squared error (MSE) on the Olivetti face dataset compared to N MSE provided by the state-of-the-art method. Moreover, we obtained N dB peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) on the SVHN dataset and N dB on the CelebA dataset, compared to N dB and N dB, provided by the state-of-the-art methods, respectively. The code is publicly available.
