segmentation plays a crucial role in liver structural analyses, volume measurements, and clinical operations (e.g., surgical planning) . For clinical usage, the accurate segmentation of a liver is one of the key components of automated radiological diagnosis systems. The manual or semi-automatic segmentation of the liver is an impractical task because of its large shape variability and unclear boundaries. Unlike other organs, ambiguous boundaries with heart, stomach, pancreas, and fat make liver segmentation difficult. Thus, for a computer-aided diagnosis system, the fully automatic and accurate segmentation of the liver plays an important role in medical imaging. \par Multiple methods have been proposed to segment a liver _cite_ . The simplest and most intuitive approaches to perform liver segmentation are thresholding and region growing _cite_ . Active contour model approaches _cite_ have also been reported, mainly using intensity distributions. However, such a local intensity-based approach easily fails owing to the great variability of shapes and intensity contrasts. Shape-prior-based methods such as active shape model, statistical shape model, and registration-based methods have been developed to overcome such difficulties _cite_ . Shape-based methods are more successful than simple intensity-based methods owing to embedded shape priors. However, the shape-based methods suffer from limited prior information because of the difficulty of embedding all inter-patient organ shapes. Thus, the number of training statistical models directly affects the model matching performance. \par In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have widely been used for various imaging applications _cite_ . For imaging applications, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most effective used network with respect to image classification _cite_, segmentation _cite_, and enhancement _cite_ . Various active studies have successfully applied CNNs to medical image segmentation _cite_ . The U-net applies contracting and expanding paths together with skip connections, which successfully combines both low and high-level features _cite_ . However, the U-net is not suitable for volumetric image segmentation as it is a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on ND images. A ND network architecture cannot leverage complex ND anatomical information. The ND U-net has been used to overcome the limitation of the original U-net architecture to extract ND contextual information via ND convolutions with sparse annotations _cite_ . However, the ND U-net presents limitations of slice-based annotations. In _cite_, a full ND-CNN-based U-net-like architecture was reported to segment volumetric medical images using a dice coefficient loss metric and overcome the class imbalance issue. The deep contour-aware network _cite_ has been developed to depict clear contours with a multi-task framework. The VoxResNet has performed brain tissue segmentation using a voxelwise residual network _cite_ . A residual learning mechanism has been used to classify each voxel _cite_ . Subsequently, an auto-context algorithm _cite_ has been employed to further refine the voxelwise prediction results. Deeply supervised networks _cite_ have been developed to hierarchically supervise multiple layers and segment medical images _cite_ . Deep supervision has allowed effective fast learning and regularization of the network. A fully connected conditional random field model has been applied as a post-processing step to refine the segmentation results _cite_ . In _cite_, the incorporation of global shape information with neural networks was presented. A convolutional autoencoder network was constructed to learn anatomical shape variations from training images _cite_ . \par Herein, we propose a deeply self-supervising CNN with adaptive contour features. Instead of learning explicit ground-truth contour features such as in reference _cite_, we guide a neural network to learn complementary contour region that can aid the accurate delineation of the target liver object. The main objective for learning partially significant contour is that, unlike other segmentation problems (e.g., glands), the contour of a liver is difficult to obtain accurately, even with DNNs, because of its ambiguous boundaries. Learned partial contours are later fused with a global shape prediction to derive the final segmentation (Fig. _ref_) . As shown in Fig. _ref_, the network can be interpreted as a contour embedded shape estimation that uses three discriminative features: shape, contour, and deep features. Similar to the method presented in reference _cite_, the proposed base network architecture was designed as a densely connected V-net structure _cite_ . The number of parameters and layers are effectively reduced using a densely connected network architecture _cite_ and separable convolutions while preserving the network capability. Finally, the learned DNN was used for automatic segmentation of the liver from CT images. \par The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section {}, several CNN models that are closely related to the proposed method are reviewed. The proposed method is described in Section {} .
