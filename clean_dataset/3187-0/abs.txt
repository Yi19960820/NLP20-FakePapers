Hyperspectral imaging has become a mature technology which brings exciting possibilities in many domains, including satellite image analysis. However, the high dimensionality and volume of such imagery is a serious problem which needs to be faced in Earth Observation applications, where efficient acquisition, transfer and storage of hyperspectral images are key factors. To reduce the cost of transferring hyperspectral data from a satellite back to Earth, various band selection techniques have been proposed. In this letter, we introduce a new hyperspectral band selection algorithm which couples new attention-based convolutional neural networks with anomaly detection. Our rigorous experiments showed that the deep models equipped with the attention mechanism deliver high-quality classification, and consistently identify significant bands in the training data, permitting the creation of refined and extremely compact sets that retain the most meaningful features.
