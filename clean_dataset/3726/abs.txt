\noindent Automated detection of sclerotic metastases (bone lesions) in Computed Tomography (CT) images has potential to be an important tool in clinical practice and research. State-of-the-art methods show performance of N \% sensitivity or true-positive (TP) rate, at N false-positives (FP) per volume. We design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework to first operate a highly sensitive candidate generation system at a maximum sensitivity of _inline_eq_ N \% but with high FP level (_inline_eq_ N per patient) . Regions of interest (ROI) for lesion candidates are generated in this step and function as input for the second tier. In the second tier we generate _inline_eq_ ND views, via scale, random translations, and rotations with respect to each ROI centroid coordinates. These random views are used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign individual probabilities for a new set of _inline_eq_ random views that are averaged at each ROI to compute a final per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a highly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving high sensitivities. We validate the approach on CT images of N patients (N with sclerotic metastases and N normal controls) . The proposed method reduces the number of FP/vol. from N to N, N to N, and N to N when comparing a sensitivity rates of N \%, N \%, and N \% respectively in testing. The Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) is N The results show marked improvement upon previous work.
