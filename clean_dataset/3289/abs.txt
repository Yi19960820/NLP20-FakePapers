We present recursive recurrent neural networks with attention modeling (R _inline_eq_ AM) for lexicon-free optical character recognition in natural scene images. The primary advantages of the proposed method are: (N) use of recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which allow for parametrically efficient and effective image feature extraction; (N) an implicitly learned character-level language model, embodied in a recurrent neural network which avoids the need to use N-grams; and (N) the use of a soft-attention mechanism, allowing the model to selectively exploit image features in a coordinated way, and allowing for end-to-end training within a standard backpropagation framework. We validate our method with state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets: Street View Text, IIITNk, ICDAR and SynthNk.
