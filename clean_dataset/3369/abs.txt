With a large influx of dermoscopy images and a growing shortage of dermatologists, automatic dermoscopic image analysis plays an essential role in skin cancer diagnosis. In this paper, a new deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) is proposed to automatically segment melanoma out of skin images by end-to-end learning with only pixels and labels as inputs. Our proposed FCNN is capable of using both local and global information to segment melanoma by adopting skipping layers. The public benchmark database consisting of N validation images, N test images and N training images in the melanoma detection challenge N at International Symposium Biomedical Imaging N is used to test the performance of our algorithm. All large size images (for example, _inline_eq_ pixels) are reduced to much smaller images with _inline_eq_ pixels (more than N times smaller) . We got and submitted preliminary results to the challenge without any pre or post processing. The performance of our proposed method could be further improved by data augmentation and by avoiding image size reduction.
