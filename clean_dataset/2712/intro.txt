Jigsaw puzzles are a popular form of entertainment, available in different variation of difficulty to challenge children, adults and even professional players. Given _inline_eq_ different non-overlapping tiles of an image, the objective is to reconstruct the original image, taking advantage of both the shape and chromatic information of each piece. Despite the popularity and vast distribution of jigsaw puzzles, their assembly is not trivial computationally, as this problem was proven to be NP-hard~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ . Nevertheless, a computational jigsaw solver may have applications in many real-world applications, such as biology~ _cite_, chemistry~ _cite_, literature~ _cite_, speech descrambling~ _cite_, archeology~ _cite_ ~ _cite_, image editing~ _cite_, and the recovery of shredded documents or photographs~ _cite_ . Regardless, as noted in~ _cite_, research of the topic may be justified solely due to its intriguing nature. Recent years have witnessed a vast improvement in the research and development of automatic jigsaw puzzle solvers, manifested in both puzzle size, solution accuracy, and amount of manual human intervention required. In its most basic form, every puzzle solver requires some function to evaluate the compatibility of adjacent pieces and a strategy for placing the pieces as accurately as possible. Most strategies are greedy and rely heavily on some ``trick'' to estimate whether two pieces are truly adjacent (e.g. two pieces that are each the most compatible piece from all pieces to one another, four pieces that form a loop where each pair's compatibility is above a threshold, etc) . Such heuristics were dubbed an ``estimation metric'' in~ _cite_, as they allow estimating the adjacency correctness of two pieces without knowing the correct solution. The majority of recent works focused on devising elaborate, hand-crafted compatibility functions and high-precision estimation metrics. Despite the proven effectiveness of neural networks in the field of computer vision, no attempt has been made to automatically devise a high-precision estimation metric for the jigsaw puzzle problem. This might be due to the highly imbalanced nature of the puzzle problem, as in each _inline_eq_ puzzle, there are _inline_eq_ matching piece-pairs and _inline_eq_ possible mismatching ones. In this paper we propose a novel estimation metric relying on neural networks. The proposed metric achieves extremely high precision despite the lack of any manually extracted features. The proposed metric proves to be highly effective in real-world scenarios. We incorporated the metric in our GA-based solver, using no hand-crafted sophisticated compatibility measure and experimented with the currently known challenging benchmarks of the hardest variant of the jigsaw puzzle problem: non-overlapping, _inline_eq_ square pieces (i.e. only chromatic information is available to the solver) where both piece orientation and puzzle dimensions are unknown. The enhanced solver proposed sets a new state-of-the-art in terms of the accuracy of the solutions obtained and the number of perfectly reconstructed puzzles.
