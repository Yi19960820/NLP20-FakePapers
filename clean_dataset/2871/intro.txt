one single shot or multiple shots of an object, person re-identification~ (Re-ID) aims at matching the stated person among various candidates from a set of disjoint camera views~ _cite_ . Person Re-ID is a key technology to many advanced multimedia applications, such as person association~ _cite_, multi-target tracking~ _cite_ and behavior analysis~ _cite_ . In theses tasks, the appearance of an object usually possesses large variations due to background clutter, lighting condition, view angle and mutual occlusion~ _cite_, as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . These challenges have made person Re-ID a very difficult problem, which has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in computer vision. The key to improve the identification performance is to learn both discriminative and stable feature representation to describe the appearance of person, in which the difference between intra/inter-class distance can be maximized. Existing person Re-ID works can be broadly grouped into the following two lines: N) developing robust feature representation to handle the variations in persons' appearance, and N) designing discriminative distance metrics to measure the similarity between intra/inter-class image distance. In the first category, different cues have been adopted to extract stable and discriminative features, and representative works including the Local Binary Pattern~ (LBP) ~ _cite_, Ensemble of Local Feature~ (ELF) ~ _cite_ and Local Maximal Occurrence~ (LOMO) ~ _cite_ ; In the second category, labeled images are used to train a distance metric, in which the intra-class distance is minimized while the inter-class distance is maximized. Typical metric learning methods include the Locally Adaptive Decision Function~ (LADF) ~ _cite_, Large Margin Nearest Neighbor~ (LMNN) ~ _cite_ and Information Theoretic Metric Learning~ (ITML) ~ _cite_ . Since both lines of works regard the feature extraction and metric learning processes as two disjoint steps, their performance is limited. Recently, the deep convolutional neural network~ (CNN) based methods are becoming popular in solving the person Re-ID problem~ _cite_ . Although these methods usually consist of two major components analogue to that of the traditional person Re-ID literature, i.e., a deep CNN to extract the appearance feature and a similarity measure to enforce the learned feature to be similar/dissimilar for intra/inter-class samples, by incorporating the feature extraction step and the metric learning step into one integrated framework, these deep CNN based method exhibits significantly improved performance for person Re-ID, where the extracted features are robust to the appearance variations across different camera views. Despite the progress achieved by these deep learning based methods, it is observed that the lacking of labeled training data usually limits their generalization ability in practical person Re-ID applications. The situation has motivated us to focus on the following two aspects to improve the generalization ability of a person Re-ID system: N) the CNN should not be too deep, and N) the loss function should incorporate additional prior knowledge to be more efficient at training. In this paper, we propose a novel set to set~ (SNS) distance metric to supervise the trained CNN to learn more discriminative and robust appearance feature based on the same amount of training data. Specifically, we first build a part-based CNN to extract the image feature in which different body parts are separately modeled in lower convolutional layers and then fused in higher fully connected layers. The resulting feature representations are then fed into the SNS loss layer which focuses on preserving the compactness of intra-class samples for each camera view, while maximizing the margin between the intra-class set and inter-class set. In this way, our method naturally incorporates the feature extraction and metric learning into a joint framework. By considering the set to set similarity, the proposed model can extract features that is robust to the appearance variations as evidenced by the improved person Re-ID performance for several public benchmark datasets. In summary, the main components of our method includes: The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In Section~ _ref_, we briefly review the related works.
