We propose a unified formulation for the problem of ND human pose estimation from a single raw RGB image that reasons jointly about ND joint estimation and ND pose reconstruction to improve both tasks. We take an integrated approach that fuses probabilistic knowledge of ND human pose with a multi-stage CNN architecture and uses the knowledge of plausible ND landmark locations to refine the search for better ND locations. The entire process is trained end-to-end, is extremely efficient and obtains state-of-the-art results on N outperforming previous approaches both on ND and ND errors.
