This letter focuses on solving the challenging problem of detecting natural image boundaries. A boundary usually refers to the border between two regions with different semantic meanings. Therefore, a measurement of dissimilarity between image regions plays a pivotal role in boundary detection of natural images. To improve the performance of boundary detection, a is proposed to replace _inline_eq_ difference adopted by the classical algorithm . Compared with _inline_eq_ difference, LBM is composed of a single layer neural network and an RBF kernel, and is fine-tuned by supervised learning rather than human-crafted. It is more effective in describing the dissimilarity between natural image regions while tolerating large variance of image data. After substituting _inline_eq_ difference with LBM, the F-measure metric of on the BSDSN benchmark is increased from N to N Moreover, when image features are computed on a single scale, the proposed LBM algorithm still achieves competitive results compared with, which makes use of multi-scale image features.
