The color constancy problem is addressed by structured-output regression on the values of the fully-connected layers of a convolutional neural network. The AlexNet and the VGG are considered and VGG slightly outperformed AlexNet. Best results were obtained with the first fully-connected " {\it fc} _inline_eq_ " layer and with multi-output support vector regression. Experiments on the SFU Color Checker and Indoor Dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, outperforming the state of the art on the SFU indoor benchmark.
