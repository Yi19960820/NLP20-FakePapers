MRI is a widely used non-invasive technique for studying and characterizing diseases of the optic pathway such as optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and optic pathway glioma (OPG) _cite_ . OPGs are low grade astrocytomas inherent to the AVP (i.e., optic nerve, chiasm and tracts) . OPGs occur in _inline_eq_ of children with neurofibromatosis type N (NFN), a very common genetic disorder {that carries increased risk of tumors in the nervous system} . The disease course is variable, as these tumors may demonstrate several distinct periods of growth, stability or regression. {{Currently, no quantitative imaging criteria exist to define OPGs secondary to NFN}} . Non-invasive computer-aided quantification of these changes can not only eliminate excessive physicianâ€™s effort to segment these regions but also increases the precision of volume measures. However, automatic segmentation of cranial nerve pathways including AVP from MRI is challenging due to their thin-long shape and varying appearances. A few non-invasive automated methods to segment AVP from radiological images have been reported in the literature previously with modest success. Bekes et al. _cite_ proposed a geometrical model based approach; however, their approach's reproducibility is found to be less than _inline_eq_ . Noble et al. _cite_ presented a hybrid approach using a deformable model with level set method to segment the optic nerves and the chiasm; {{however, the method was tested only on healthy cases} . Recently, Yang et al. _cite_ developed a partitioned approach to healthy AVP segmentation by dividing the pathway into various shape homogenous segments and modeling each segment independently. The local appearance information in their approach was encoded using the normalized derivatives, three class fuzzy c-means, and spherical flux} . {{The approach was the first attempt to accommodate local shape and appearance variation for healthy AVP segmentation}} ; the method, although promising, did not provide any objective criteria on the optimal number of partitions. Moreover, the approach did not accommodate local appearance characteristics along the nerve boundary that are particularly important in pathological cases. Depending on severity, pathological AVPs can have a drastically different local shape and appearance characteristics than healthy ones, thus failing the shape model based segmentation methods in cranial nerve pathways. To illustrate, Fig _ref_ (a) demonstrates a healthy optic nerve along with a contralateral optic nerve having OPG. Fig _ref_ (b)-(c) show the renderings of cases with OPG in optic nerve region. In this paper, we propose,, an optimally partitioned statistical shape model with sparse appearance learning for the segmentation of AVPs for both healthy and pathological cases. The challenge of segmenting larger anatomical structures with pathologies have been addressed numerously in the literature _cite_ . However, development of similar approaches for {{smaller vascular structures, such as the AVP,}} have traditionally been ignored. {{By illustrating the robustness of PAScAL to segment AVP with OPG, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in segmenting other anatomical structures of similar characteristics.}}
