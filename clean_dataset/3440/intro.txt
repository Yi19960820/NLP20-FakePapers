Deep and wide max-pooling convolutional neural networks (MPCNN) on GPU _cite_ embody the current state of the art in stationary pattern recognition. They outperformed other methods on image classification _cite_, object detection _cite_, and image segmentation _cite_ . Through output averaging, several independently trained deep NN (DNN) can form a Multi-Column DNN (MCDNN) with error rates N-N \% below those of single DNN _cite_ . In N, our MCDNN were the first to achieve first human-competitive performance on the famous MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, e.g., _cite_ . Chinese handwriting, however, is much harder, as there are not only N classes (one for each digit), but N. Here we apply our MCDNN to data from the ICDAR N competition _cite_ on recognizing offline handwritten Chinese characters. We present results obtained after correcting a bug (Section~ _ref_) in the image preprocessing routine.
