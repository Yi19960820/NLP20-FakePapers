Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent non-invasive diagnostic tool to accurately assess pathologies in several anatomies. However, MRI is fundamentally constrained in optimizing for either high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or low scan durations. Enhancing one of the three outcomes necessarily degrades one or both of the others. Additionally, unlike other imaging modalities, MR images are qualitative in nature and do not directly correlate to the underlying tissue physiology. While quantitative MRI may help in assessing tissue biochemistry and longitudinal changes, biomarker accuracy is extremely sensitive to image SNR. Consequently, it is challenging to develop a single MRI method to produce high-resolution morphological images with high quantitative biomarker accuracy in a reasonable scan time, which is tolerable for patients and which ultimately limits cost of the procedure. The double-echo in steady-state (DESS) pulse sequence can generate high-resolution images with diagnostic contrast as well as the quantitative biomarker of T _inline_eq_ relaxation time, in only five-minutes of scan time _cite_ . The T _inline_eq_ relaxation time has shown to be sensitive to collagen matrix organization and tissue hydration levels, and is useful for assessing degradation of tissues such as cartilage, menisci, tendons, and ligaments _cite_ . DESS intrinsically produces two images with independent contrasts. The first echo of DESS (S _inline_eq_) has a T _inline_eq_ /T _inline_eq_ weighting while the second echo of DESS (S _inline_eq_) has a high T _inline_eq_ weighting. In previous applications of DESS, the S _inline_eq_ and S _inline_eq_ scans are combined during the reconstruction process to produce an output with a singular contrast (herein referred as single-contrast DESS) _cite_ . However, separating the two echoes can provide considerable diagnostic utility since both echoes are sensitive to varying pathologies. Additionally, the two independent-contrast images (herein referred as dual-contrast DESS) can be used to analytically determine the tissue T _inline_eq_ relaxation time, which is a promising biomarker for tissue degradation and OA progression _cite_ . Example images comparing the output of single-contrast DESS and dual-contrast DESS are shown in Fig. _ref_ . Dual-contrast DESS has shown to be useful in diagnostic musculoskeletal imaging of knee as well as in research studies for evaluating OA progression _cite_ . While promising, the dual-contrast DESS is limited in acquiring slices with N section-thickness to maintain adequate SNR for T _inline_eq_ measurements of the cartilage and menisci. Compared to an in-plane resolution of N, such a high-section thickness precludes multi-planar reformations, which are essential for evaluating thin knee tissues in arbitrary planes, due to excessive image blurring. An ideal acquisition would provide sub-millimeter section thickness without biasing T _inline_eq_ measurements. Advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ND super-resolution (SR) methods may enable acquisition of slices with a thickness of N followed by retrospectively achieving sub-millimeter resolution, while maintaining SNR for T _inline_eq_ measurements _cite_ . However, unlike the single-contrast DESS that has hundreds of datasets publicly available, the dual-contrast DESS is a newer sequence with very limited amounts of high-resolution data available, which makes it challenging to create a SR CNN from scratch. In such scenarios, transfer learning methods may be helpful in overcoming the limitations of a paucity of high-resolution ground-truth dual-contrast DESS training data. Specifically, it may be possible to train a SR CNN initially using single-contrast DESS datasets and subsequently adapt the network to enhance dual-contrast DESS images using limited training data. Consequently, this study aimed to answer: N. Can transfer learning enhance through-plane MRI resolution for the clinically-relevant dual-contrast DESS sequence and N. Can transfer learning enable accurate quantitative imaging of the T _inline_eq_ relaxation time by overcoming SNR limitations commonly faced in high-resolution imaging? The overall goal of this study was to evaluate whether there can be an efficient methodology to create a SR CNN for dual-contrast DESS to produce high-resolution morphological and quantitative images.
