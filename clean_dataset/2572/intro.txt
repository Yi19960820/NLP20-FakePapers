The successful application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ImageNet challenge _cite_ by Krizhevsky et al. _cite_ has had a large impact on the field of computer vision. Biomedical image analysis is a particular area benefiting from latest advancements in computer vision methodology, but it only recently adapted deep learning techniques on a wider scale _cite_ . Adaptation of deep learning to biomedical imaging problems requires speciality operations and the lack of low-threshold access to validated reference implementations has led to slow progress. To address this, we present DLTK, a Deep Learning Toolkit for Medical Image Analysis. DLTK simplifies the application and experimentation with deep learning methods on medical imaging data by providing validated, high-performance reference implementations and required speciality operations.
