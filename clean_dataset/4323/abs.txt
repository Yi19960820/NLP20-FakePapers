In this paper we are interested in analyzing behaviour in crowded public places at the level of . Our aim is to learn, without user input, strong scene priors or labelled data, the scope of ``normal behaviour'' for a particular scene and thus alert to novelty in unseen footage. The first contribution is a low-level motion model based on what we term, which are scene-specific elementary motions. We propose a clustering-based algorithm for tracklet estimation from local approximations to tracks of appearance features. This is followed by two methods for motion novelty inference from tracklet primitives: (a) we describe an approach based on a non-hierarchial ensemble of Markov chains as a means of capturing behavioural characteristics at different scales, and (b) a more flexible alternative which exhibits a higher generalizing power by accounting for constraints introduced by intentionality and goal-oriented planning of human motion in a particular scene. Evaluated on a Nh long video of a busy city marketplace, both algorithms are shown to be successful at inferring unusual behaviour, the latter model achieving better performance for novelties at a larger spatial scale.
