Classification of imbalance data is one of a classic problem in the artificial intelligence area, especially for classification in machine learning. Imbalance data has been proved can decrease the performance of machine learning algorithm _cite_, where imbalance data means the total of data from each class is significantly different. The example of imbalance data can be seen in the works from Cenggoro et al. _cite_ . The data from those researches shows that classes of an urban area is up to N \% from the total area, while the class of an open area is only N \% from the total area. Usually, machine learning algorithm cannot learn this kind of data, especially for minority classes because the information is covered by majority classes data. There are some researches in deep learning area that is trying to prevent classification in imbalance data _cite_ . However, these researches still use algorithm that assumes the training dataset is imbalance. This assumption can decrease the performance of the algorithm if it is used for balance training dataset.
