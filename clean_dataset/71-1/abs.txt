The idea to use automated algorithms to determine geological facies from well logs is not new (see e.g _cite_ ; _cite_) but the recent and dramatic increase in research in the field of machine learning makes it a good time to revisit the topic. Following an exercise proposed by _cite_ and _cite_ we employ a modern type of deep convolutional network, called inception network _cite_, to tackle the supervised classification task and we discuss the methodological limits of such problem as well as further research opportunities.
