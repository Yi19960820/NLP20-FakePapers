We explore the problem of classification within a medical image data-set based on a feature vector extracted from the deepest layer of pre-trained Convolution Neural Networks. We have used feature vectors from several pre-trained structures, including networks with/without transfer learning to evaluate the performance of pre-trained deep features versus CNNs which have been trained by that specific dataset as well as the impact of transfer learning with a small number of samples. All experiments are done on dataset which consists of N, N histopathology training patches in N tissue texture classes along with N, N test patches for evaluation. The result shows that pre-trained networks are quite competitive against training from scratch. As well, fine-tuning does not seem to add any tangible improvement for VGGN to justify additional training while we observed considerable improvement in retrieval and classification accuracy when we fine-tuned the Inception structure.
