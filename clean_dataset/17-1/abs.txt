Traditional works have shown that patches in a natural image tend to redundantly recur many times inside the image, both within the same scale, as well as across different scales. Make full use of these multi-scale information can improve the image restoration performance. However, the current proposed deep learning based restoration methods do not take the multi-scale information into account. In this paper, we propose a dilated convolution based inception module to learn multi-scale information and design a deep network for single image super-resolution. Different dilated convolution learns different scale feature, then the inception module concatenates all these features to fuse multi-scale information. In order to increase the reception field of our network to catch more contextual information, we cascade multiple inception modules to constitute a deep network to conduct single image super-resolution. With the novel dilated convolution based inception module, the proposed end-to-end single image super-resolution network can take advantage of multi-scale information to improve image super-resolution performance. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art single image super-resolution methods.
