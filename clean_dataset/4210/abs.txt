To accelerate DNNs inference, low-rank approximation has been widely adopted because of its solid theoretical rationale and efficient implementations. Several previous works attempted to directly approximate a pre-trained model by low-rank decomposition; however, small approximation errors in parameters can ripple over a large prediction loss. Apparently, it is not optimal to separate low-rank approximation from training. Unlike previous works, this paper integrates low rank approximation and regularization into the training process. We propose Trained Rank Pruning (TRP), which alternates between low rank approximation and training. TRP maintains the capacity of the original network while imposing low-rank constraints during training. A nuclear regularization optimized by stochastic sub-gradient descent is utilized to further promote low rank in TRP. Networks trained with TRP has a low-rank structure in nature, and is approximated with negligible performance loss, thus eliminating fine-tuning after low rank approximation. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-N and ImageNet, outperforming previous compression counterparts using low rank approximation. Our code is available at: _url_ .
