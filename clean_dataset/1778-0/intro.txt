Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Computer Society Press. This style guide now has several important modifications (for example, you are no longer warned against the use of sticky tape to attach your artwork to the paper), so all authors should read this new version. All manuscripts must be in English. Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR N web page for a discussion of the policy on dual submissions. Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of N pages. {\bf There will be no extra page charges for CVPR N.} Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed. This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide. Note that this \LaTeX \guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font. The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts. The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven. The \LaTeX \style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review. The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution. If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX \document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages. The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page. The camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX \users may uncomment the \verb' \cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.) Reviewers: note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper---this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly. Just use fractional references (e.g. \this line is _inline_eq_), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate. Please number all of your sections and displayed equations. It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation. Just because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader might not need to refer to it. It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page N column N''. (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers) . All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics: _url_ . Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review. Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available. Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work. That is all. (But see below for techreports.) Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [N] '' does not say that you are Lucy Smith; it says that you are building on her work. If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [N] '', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [N] '' and at the end of the paper, include reference N as you would any other cited work. An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected: An example of an acceptable paper: If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work. In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~ _cite_ as additional material and cite it as Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report. For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a techreport for further details. Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~ _cite_ ''. Then submit the techreport as additional material. Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material. Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which is widely known to be restricted to a single institution. For example, let's say it's N, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the CVPRN audience would like to hear about your solution. The work is a development of your celebrated N paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal. You can handle this paper like any other. Don't write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, N] . This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review] ''. That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead write the following: As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors. A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess. He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B. FAQ: Are acknowledgements OK? No. Leave them for the final copy. \noindent Compare the following: See The \TeX book, pN. The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not. The provided \verb' \eg' macro takes care of this. When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to `` \etal'' (not `` {\em et. \al.} '' as `` {\em et} '' is a complete word.) However, use it only when there are three or more authors. Thus, the following is correct: `` Frobnication has been trendy lately. It was introduced by Alpher~ _cite_, and subsequently developed by Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~ _cite_, and Alpher \etal~ _cite_ .'' This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~ _cite_ ...'' because reference~ _cite_ has just two authors. If you use the \verb' \etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal. For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not chronological) order, so prefer _cite_ to _cite_ .
