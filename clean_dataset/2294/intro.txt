Advances in deep learning _cite_ are being made at a rapid pace, in part due to challenges such as ILSVRC--the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge _cite_ . Successive improvements in deep neural network architectures have resulted in computer vision systems that are better able to recognize and classify objects in images _cite_ and winning ILSVRC entries _cite_ . While a large focus of deep learning has been on automated analysis of image and text data, advances are also increasingly being seen in areas that require processing other input modalities. One such area is the medical domain where inputs into a deep learning system could be physiologic time series data. An increasing number of large scale challenges in the medical domain, such as _cite_ and _cite_ have also resulted in improvements to deep learning architectures _cite_ . PhysioNet _cite_ has held a Computing in Cardiology Challenge since N that requires participants to automatically analyze physiologic time series data. The N challenge _cite_ asked participants to perform automated analysis of phonocardiogram (PCG) waveforms, i.e. heart sound data collected using digital stethoscopes. The objective of the challenge was to accurately classify normal and abnormal heart sounds. Recordings were collected from both healthy individuals, as well as those with heart disease, including heart valve disease and coronary artery disease. A PCG plot showing the recording of the (normal) sounds made by the heart is given in Figure _ref_ . Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, resulting in more people dying every year due to cardiovascular disease compared to any other cause of death _cite_ . Successful automated PCG analysis can serve as a useful diagnostic tool to help determine whether an individual should be referred on for expert diagnosis, particularly in areas where access to clinicians and medical care is limited. In this work, we present an algorithm that accepts PCG waveforms as input and uses a deep convolutional neural network architecture to classify inputs as either normal or abnormal using the following steps: The contributions of this work are as follows: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section _ref_, we discuss related works, including historical approaches to automated heart sound analysis and deep learning approaches that process physiologic time series input data. Section _ref_ introduces our approach and details each step of the algorithm. Section _ref_ further describes the modified cost-sensitive loss function used to trade-off the sensitivity and specificity of the network's predictions, followed by Section _ref_, which details the network training decisions and parameters. Section _ref_ presents results from the N PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge and in Section _ref_ we provide a final discussion and end with conclusions in Section _ref_ .
