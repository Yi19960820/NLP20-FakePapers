A central problem in materials design is the analysis, characterization, and control of materials microstructure. Microstructure is generated by non-equilibrium processes during the formation of the material and plays a large role in the bulk material's properties~ _cite_ . In recent years, machine learning and informatics based approaches to materials design have generated much interest~ _cite_ . Effective statistical representation of microstructure has emerged as an outstanding challenge~ _cite_ . Standard approaches begin with an _inline_eq_-point expansion, and typically truncate at the pair correlation level~ _cite_ . Pair correlations can capture information such as the scale of domains in a system, but miss higher order complexities such as the detailed shape of domains or relative orientation of nearby domains~ _cite_ . Three-point correlations (and successors) quickly become computationally infeasible, as the number of _inline_eq_-point correlations scales exponentially with _inline_eq_ . Furthermore, they are not tailored to capture the statistical information of interest. Much current work involves deploying a set of modified two-point correlations to better capture certain microstructural features~ _cite_ . Independently, researchers in machine learning for computer vision have been developing powerful techniques to analyze image content~ _cite_ . Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a particularly powerful tool for image analysis~ _cite_ . Of particular interest to materials microstructure analysis is literature regarding reconstruction and modeling~ _cite_ ; in this context a texture is an image with roughly translation invariant statistics. Indeed, Gatys et al. have recently demonstrated that correlations between CNN activations capture the statistics of textures exceptionally well~ _cite_ . Here, we apply the Gatys et al. CNN {\em texture vector} representation of image statistics to the problem of characterizing materials micrographs. The texture vector is a statistical representation of an image derived from the processing of a pre-trained CNN; we use the Visual Geometry Group's VGG-N network~ _cite_, which has been trained to classify N million natural images~ _cite_ . We demonstrate that the texture vectors generated using the VGG-N network can capture complex statistical correlations visible in microstructure images in Fig.~ _ref_ . Specifically, we use the CNN texture vector to characterize an original microstructural image, and then generate a new, random image constrained to the same statistics. It is remarkable that using only a single original image, the algorithm generates texture images nearly indistinguishable to the eye. In the case of materials micrographs, where data can be expensive to collect, the ability for a method perform well on small datasets is crucial. Our approach can be considered one of,, the application of a model trained on one problem to achieve results on a different, but related problem. The fidelity in Fig.~ _ref_ motivates us to pursue the CNN texture vector as a tool for mapping relationships between materials processing, microstructure, and properties. As a step towards microstructure analysis, we demonstrate and quantify the ability of the CNN texture vector to extract hidden information from a collection of synthetic texture images. Images in our datasets are generated under different ``processing'' conditions, a few generating parameters. The goal is to extract a compact statistical representation of the dataset that captures the relevant statistics associated with the hidden generating parameters---that is, to back out the processing parameters of micrographs directly from the images alone. Our use of synthetic data, with a tightly controlled ground truth, provides us quantitative measures of error in the unsupervised learning process. Despite being very high-dimensional, the CNN texture vector offers a good notion of abstract distance between texture images: The closer the generating parameters, the smaller the distance between texture vectors. We use to embed each image as a point in a low-dimensional space such that, ideally, the embedded distances match the texture vector distances. The structure of the embedded points then reveals information about the set of images. For our synthetic dataset, we show a simple relationship between the embedded coordinates and the generating parameters. More broadly, dimensionality reduction techniques may serve as the basis for characterization of materials properties that are controlled by complex materials microstructures. A recent example is the work of Ref.~, which uses a method similar to ours to map the space of ultrahigh carbon steel microstructures. Our approach applies learning, a pattern-discovery framework to seek new aspects of microstructure without using labeled data. This approach is applicable to problems where the ground truth is unknown,, the forensic analysis of microstructures. Several recent applications of machine learning to microstructure have used learning algorithms~ _cite_ such as support vector machines and classification trees, which make inferences based on labeled data. Like our work, Ref.~ uses image features extracted from CNNs to aid microstructure analysis. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section~II gives background on recent CNN architectures for image recognition, and specifics of the VGG network. Section~III details our algorithms for statistical microstructure analysis and Sec.~IV evaluates their accuracy on test datasets. Section~V provides discussion and interpretation of our results, and we conclude in Sec. VI.
