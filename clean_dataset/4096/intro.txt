In the medical domain, preservation of patient privacy is paramount, and hence access to data is often intrinsically limited to research groups~ _cite_, _cite_ . Medical datasets, similar to financial~ _cite_ and genomics~ _cite_ datasets, are also very limited because they are often imbalanced~ _cite_ . Such imbalances in datasets potentially make the training of neural networks with equally high accuracy across classes technically challenging. Some medical problems are commonly encountered in hospital settings which leads to a substantial amount of data associated with them. However, rare conditions or syndromes such as Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome are expected to have limited amounts of data in clinical databases~ _cite_ . The challenge of image availability across classes may be partially met by data augmentation techniques, for example, applying transformations to images to augment the dataset. The importance of balancing datasets is highlighted by the fact that deep neural networks may be most valuable in the work up of rare or challenging diseases, which practitioners at a common skill level may fail to recognize or misinterpret~ _cite_ . Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown to effectively generate artificial data indiscernible from their real counterparts~ _cite_ . Some examples are statistical parametric speech synthesis~ _cite_, learning representations of emotional speech~ _cite_, noise reduction in low-dose computed tomography (CT) ~ _cite_, and retinal image synthesis~ _cite_ . We propose the simulation of medical pathology in images as a means of augmenting data in a controlled fashion. Simulated data can be used to increase the number of images available and hence provide a means to balance datasets for the training of deep neural networks. An ideal data simulation scheme would be capable of generating an arbitrary number of synthetic images, which mimic the features of real images in any given class with sufficient diversity for the successful training of a deep network. In this manuscript, we propose the use of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for the generation of chest X-rays that mimic common chest pathologies. The synthetic images are used to balance and augment a labeled set of chest X-rays for the training of the proposed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) across five pathological classes.
