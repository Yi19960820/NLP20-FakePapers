Deep neural networks have achieved great success in image and video processing tasks. Capsule Net (CapsNet) _cite_ is a recently proposed architecture that represents an alternative arrangement of multiple stage processing of image data. Essentially, CapsNet differs from the traditional deep neural networks in i) in each stage, the atomic units of information are vectors rather than scalar values, and ii) the output of a processing stage no longer contributes equally to the computation of its successive stage. One can intuitively understand the changes as introducing structures in the information and the information no longer flows homogeneously through the processing pipeline. We present in this work our investigation on three aspects of CapsNet, answering three fundamental questions about the effectiveness of the new architecture in terms of visual analytics, namely model fitting, representation learning and generalization: In the remaining parts of this paper, we review necessary background in Section _ref_ . presents the main findings of the research in three aspects. Section _ref_ concludes the paper.
