Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are considered the state-of-the-art for image segmentation problems _cite_ . One limitation of deep CNNs is that they requires large volumes of training data in order to generalize well _cite_ . Unfortunately, acquisition of manual segmentation labels is a time-consuming process that requires domain expertise to produce an acceptable ground truth. This is most notable in the domain of medical images, for which accurate delineation of structures require many years of experience on the part of the annotator. In contrast, spatial localization of the same structure of interest is often relatively simple, exhibits lower variance, and takes significantly less time to perform. In this work, we explore the potential of CNNs to learn transferable features from easily-labeled data to tasks that would normally require larger quantities of expertly-labeled data to achieve the same performance. To demonstrate our approach, we consider the task of segmenting the optic disc from retinal fundus photographs. The optic disc is readily discernible from fundus photographs and can have differing coloration and morphology as a consequence of both normal variation and pathology such as glaucoma _cite_ . Segmentation of the optic disk allows for such characteristics to be readily quantified from conventional fundus images.
