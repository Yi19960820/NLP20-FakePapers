Face hallucination refers to the technique of reconstructing a High-Resolution (HR) face image with fine details from an observed Low-Resolution (LR) face image with the help of HR/LR training pairs~ _cite_ . It is a domain specific image super-resolution method, which focuses on the human face, and can transcend the limitations of an imaging system, thus providing very important clues about objects for criminals recognition. Due to the highly underdetermined constraints and possible noise, image super-resolution is a seriously ill-posed problem and needs the prior information to regularize the solution space. Mathematically, let _inline_eq_ denotes the observed LR face image, and the target HR face image _inline_eq_ can be deduced by minimizing an energy function composed of a fidelity term and a regularization term balanced through a trade-off parameter _inline_eq_, According to the source of the prior information of _inline_eq_, the super-resolution techniques can be divided into two categories, model-based optimization methods and discriminative inference learning methods. The former tries to solve the problem of Eq. (_ref_) by some time-consuming iterative optimization algorithms, while the latter aims at learning the relationship between LR and HR images through a loss function on a training set containing LR and HR sample pairs. Therefore, the model-based optimization methods (such as LRTV~ _cite_ and NCSR~ _cite_) are very general and can be used to handle various image degradation models by specifying the matrix _inline_eq_ . In contrast, these discriminative inference learning methods are restricted by specialized image degradation model _inline_eq_ . The representative discriminative learning methods include LLE _cite_, ScSR~ _cite_, ANR~ _cite_, SRCNN~ _cite_, VDSR~ _cite_, and some methods specifically for face images, TDN~ _cite_, UR-DGN~ _cite_, CBN~ _cite_, and LCGE~ _cite_ . Due to their end-to-end training strategy, given an LR input image, they can directly predict the target HR image in an efficient and effective way. In order to overcome the shortcomings of model-based optimization methods and discriminative inference learning methods while leveraging their respective merits, recently, some approaches have been proposed to handle the fidelity term and the regularization term separately, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, such as ADMM optimization or Regularization by Denoising (RED) ~ _cite_ . A model-based super-resolution method tries to iteratively reconstruct an HR image, so that its degraded LR image matches the input LR image, while inference learning tries to train a denoiser by machine learning, using the pairs of LR and HR images. Therefore, the complex super-resolution reconstruction problem is decomposed into a sequence of image denoising tasks, coupled with quadratic norm regularized least-squares optimization problems that are much easier to deal with. In many real surveillance scenarios, cameras are usually far from the interested object, and the bandwidth and storage resources of systems are limited, which generally result in very small face images,, tiny faces. Although the above-mentioned method is general and can be used to handle various image degradation processes, the performance of this method will become very poor when the sampling factor is very large,, the input LR face image is very small. The learned denoiser prior can not take full advantage of the structure of human face, thus the hallucinated HR faces still lack detailed features, as shown in the second column of Figure~ _ref_ . In general, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) denoiser prior based face hallucination method generates primary face structures fairly well, but fails to return much high-frequency content. To deal with the bottlenecks of very small input images, some deep neural networks based methods have been proposed _cite_ . In this paper, we develop a novel face hallucination approach via Deep CNN Denoiser and Multi-layer Neighbor Component Embedding (MNCE) . Inspired by the work of _cite_, we adopt CNN to learn the denoiser prior, which is then plugged into a model-based optimization to jointly benefit the merits of model-based optimization and discriminative inference. In this step, we can predict the intermediate results, which look smooth, by this Deep CNN denoiser. In order to enhance the detailed feature, we further propose a residual compensation method through MNCE. It extends NCE to a multi-layer framework to gradually mitigate the inconsistency between the LR and HR spaces (especially when the factor is very large), thus compensating for the missing details that have not been recovered in the first step. Figure _ref_ shows the pipeline of the proposed algorithm. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (i) We proposed a novel two-step face hallucination method which combines the benefits of model-based optimization and discriminative inference Learning. The proposed framework makes it possible to learn priors from different sources (i.e., general and face images) to simultaneously regularize face hallucination. (ii) To recover the missing detailed features, neighbor component embedding with multi-layer manner is proposed, and the hallucinated result can be gradually optimized and improved. It provides a scheme to mitigate the inconsistency between LR and HR spaces due to one-to-many mappings.
