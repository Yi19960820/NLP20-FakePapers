Inverse rendering is the problem of estimating one or more of illumination, reflectance properties and shape from observed appearance (i.e.~one or more images) . In this paper, we tackle the most challenging setting of this problem; we seek to estimate all three quantities from only a single, uncontrolled image. Specifically, we estimate a normal map, diffuse albedo map and spherical harmonic lighting coefficients. This subsumes two classical computer vision problems: (uncalibrated) shape-from-shading and intrinsic image decomposition. Classical approaches _cite_ cast these problems in terms of energy minimisation. Here, a data term measures the difference between the input image and the synthesised image that arises from the estimated quantities. We approach the problem as one of image to image translation and solve it using a deep, fully convolutional neural network. However, inverse rendering of uncontrolled, outdoor scenes is itself an unsolved problem and so labels for supervised learning are not available. Instead, we use the data term for self-supervision via a differentiable renderer (see Fig.~ _ref_) . Single image inverse rendering is an inherently ambiguous problem. For example, any image can be explained with zero data error by setting the albedo map equal to the image, the normal map to be planar and the illumination arbitrarily such that the shading is unity everywhere. Hence, the data term alone cannot be used to solve this problem. For this reason, classical methods augment the data term with generic _cite_ or object-class-specific _cite_ priors. Likewise, we also exploit priors during learning (specifically a statistical prior on lighting and a smoothness prior on diffuse albedo) . However, our key insight that enables the CNN to learn good performance is to introduce additional supervision provided by an offline multiview reconstruction. While photometric vision has largely been confined to restrictive lab settings, classical geometric methods are sufficiently robust to provide multiview ND shape reconstructions from large, unstructured datasets containing very rich illumination variation _cite_ . This is made possible by local image descriptors that are largely invariant to illumination. However, these methods recover only geometric information and any recovered texture map has illumination ``baked in'' and so is useless for relighting. We exploit the robustness of geometric methods to varying illumination to supervise our inverse rendering network. We apply a multiview stereo (MVS) pipeline to large sets of images of the same scene. We select pairs of overlapping images with different illumination, use the estimated relative pose and depth maps to cross project photometric invariants between views and use this for supervision via Siamese training. In other words, geometry provides correspondence that allows us to simulate varying illumination from a fixed viewpoint. Finally, the depth maps from MVS provide coarse normal map estimates that can be used for direct supervision of the normal map estimation. Deep learning has already shown good performance on components of the inverse rendering problem. This includes monocular depth estimation _cite_, depth and normal estimation _cite_ and intrinsic image decomposition _cite_ . However, these works use supervised learning. For tasks where ground truth does not exist, such approaches must either train on synthetic data (in which case generalisation to the real world is not guaranteed) or generate pseudo ground truth using an existing method (in which case the network is just learning to replicate the performance of the existing method) . Inverse rendering of outdoor, complex scenes is itself an unsolved problem and so reliable ground truth is not available and supervised learning cannot be used. In this context, we make the following contributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit MVS supervision for learning inverse rendering. Second, we are the first to tackle the most general version of the problem, considering arbitrary outdoor scenes and learning from real data, as opposed to restricting to a single object class _cite_ or using synthetic training data _cite_ . Third, we introduce a statistical model of spherical harmonic lighting in natural scenes that we use as a prior. Finally, the resulting network is the first to inverse render all of shape, reflectance and lighting in the wild and we perform the first evaluation in this setting.
