This paper presents an image classification based approach for skeleton-based video action recognition problem. Firstly, A dataset independent translation-scale invariant image mapping method is proposed, which transformes the skeleton videos to colour images, named skeleton-images. Secondly, A multi-scale deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed which could be built and fine-tuned on the powerful pre-trained CNNs, \eg, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet \etal. Even though the skeleton-images are very different from natural images, the fine-tune strategy still works well. At last, we prove that our method could also work well on ND skeleton video data. We achieve the state-of-the-art results on the popular benchmard datasets \eg NTU RGB + D, UTD-MHAD, MSRC-N, and GND. Especially on the largest and challenge NTU RGB + D, UTD-MHAD, and MSRC-N dataset, our method outperforms other methods by a large margion, which proves the efficacy of the proposed method.
