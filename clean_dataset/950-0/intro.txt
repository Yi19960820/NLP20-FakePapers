Lung cancer is one of the most malignant tumors in the world and its N-year-survival rate is only N \% _cite_ . Therefore, it is important to distinguish malignancy and benign lung nodules via low-does Computed Tomography (CT) images. Naturally a fast and accurate Computer-Aid Diagnosis (CAD) system for lung cancer is urgently desired. To be practical, the CAD system should satisfy the following requirements. Firstly, it has the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose the malignancy of pulmonary nodules, compare with radiologists. Secondly, in addition to the malignancy score, it can provide related evidences to help radiologists assess the malignancy predictions by the CAD system, such as high-level attributes (subtlety, calcification, margin, {\it etc.}) and nodule area segmentation. To classify pulmonary nodules in terms of their malignancy and benign, traditional works which adopted different classifiers, {\it i.e.} Support Vector Machine (SVM) _cite_, k-NN classifier _cite_ and Random Forests _cite_, with hand-crafted image features, such as HOG _cite_, ND volume feature _cite_, {\it etc.} achieved promising results. Due to the success of deep neural networks in natural images, recently some researchers tried to apply convolutional neural networks in pulmonary nodule detection _cite_, segmentation _cite_ and classification _cite_ . These studies of lung nodule classification usually extracted features via CNNs and then fed them into classifiers. However, these features are hard to understand for radiologists, which means it is not easy for them to accept the malignancy prediction without any relevant imaging findings. To tackle the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes the PN-SAMP, which can provide rich semantic information ({\it i.e.} high-level attributes) as well as the nodule segmentation. These information will help radiologists assess the malignancy prediction produced by the CAD systems. Moreover, PN-SAMP exploits multiple window widths and window centers to enrich the nodule information. Extensive experiments show that MNLSCS achieves a significant improvement with respect to pulmonary nodule classification, promising performance for pulmonary nodule segmentation and attribute learning on LIDC-IDRI dataset _cite_ . \subsection* {Contributions}
