Automated extraction and labeling of rib centerlines is a typically needed prerequisite for more advanced assisted reading tools that help the radiologist to efficiently inspect all N ribs in a CT volume. In this paper, we combine a deep learning-based rib detection with a dedicated centerline extraction algorithm applied to the detection result for the purpose of fast, robust and accurate rib centerline extraction and labeling from CT volumes. More specifically, we first apply a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to generate a probability map for detecting the pair, the pair, and the collection of all . In a second stage, a newly designed centerline extraction algorithm is applied to this multi-label probability map. Finally, the distinct detection of first and twelfth rib separately, allows to derive individual rib labels by simple sorting and counting the detected centerlines. We applied our method to CT volumes from N patients which included a variety of different challenges and achieved a centerline accuracy of N mm with respect to manual centerline annotations.
