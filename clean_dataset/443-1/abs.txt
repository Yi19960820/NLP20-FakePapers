\justifying Recent progress on salient object detection is substantial, benefiting mostly from the explosive development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) . Semantic segmentation and salient object detection algorithms developed lately have been mostly based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) . There is still a large room for improvement over the generic FCN models that do not explicitly deal with the scale-space problem. Holistically-Nested Edge Detector (HED) provides a skip-layer structure with deep supervision for edge and boundary detection, but the performance gain of HED on saliency detection is not obvious. In this paper, we propose a new salient object detection method by introducing short connections to the skip-layer structures within the HED architecture. Our framework takes full advantage of multi-level and multi-scale features extracted from FCNs, providing more advanced representations at each layer, a property that is critically needed to perform segment detection. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on _inline_eq_ widely tested salient object detection benchmarks, with advantages in terms of efficiency (_inline_eq_ seconds per image), effectiveness, and simplicity over the existing algorithms. Beyond that, we conduct an exhaustive analysis on the role of training data on performance. Our experimental results provide a more reasonable and powerful training set for future research and fair comparisons.
