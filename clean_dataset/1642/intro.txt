With pervasive applications of medical imaging in health-care, biomedical image segmentation has always been one of the most important tasks in biomedical imaging research. Biomedical image segmentation extracts different tissues, organs, pathologies, and biological structures, to support medical diagnosis, surgical planning and treatments. In common practice, segmentation is performed manually by pathologists, which is time-consuming and tedious. However, the ever-increasing quantity and variety of medical images make manual segmentation impracticable in terms of cost and reproducibility. Therefore, automatic biomedical image segmentation is highly desirable. But, this task is very challenging, because of high variability in medical images due to complex variations in biomedical objects and structures and because of low contrast, noise, and other imaging artifacts caused by various medical imaging modalities and techniques. In the past years, substantial progress has been made on biomedical image segmentation with pixel based methods _cite_ and structure based methods _cite_ . These methods achieve promising results on nonmalignant objects using hand-crafted features and prior knowledge of structures. However, they suffer considerable degradation when applied to malignant objects with serious deformation. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have been highly effective for biomedical image segmentation, which require little hand-crafted features or prior knowledge. Ronneberger et al. _cite_ proposed U-Net, a U-shaped deep convolutional network that adds a symmetric expanding path to enable precise localization. With strong use of data augmentation, this segmentation model achieves significant improvement over previous methods. The DCAN model by Chen et al. _cite_ added a unified multi-task object to the U-Net learning framework, which won the N MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge _cite_ . Based on DCAN, Yang et al. _cite_ proposed suggestive annotation which extracts representative samples as a training dataset, by adopting active learning into their network design. With the refined training samples and optimized structure for DNNs, suggestive annotation achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MICCAI Gland Segmentation dataset _cite_ . At the same time, DNN quantization has become an active research topic, which aims to represent DNN weights with less memory (precision) while maintaining acceptable accuracy with efficient memory and computation costs. It has been observed in the literature, however, that sometimes quantization can improve accuracy which can be credited to the reduction of overfitting. Dynamic fixed point are adopted in _cite_ _cite_, which achieves Nx less memory operation cost with only N-N \% Top-N accuracy loss for ImageNet classification _cite_ . Ternary weight network _cite_ and binaryConnect _cite_ have further reduced the bit-width of weights to N bits or even N bit with a relatively larger accuracy loss. Recently, their enhanced version, trained ternary training _cite_ and binary weight network _cite_ have reduced the accuracy loss to only N-N \%. There also exists some works using non-linear quantization to represent the parameter distribution for better accuracy _cite_ _cite_ . Unlike the above works, some studies aims to quantize not only the weights but also the activations. Quantized neural networks _cite_, binarized neural networks _cite_, and XNOR-net _cite_ reduced the weights to only N bit and the activations to N-N bits resulting in a large reduction on memory and computation cost yet with significant accuracy loss. Particularly, all the computation in XNOR-net are very simple XNOR operation. In some of the above works, we notice that quantization can sometimes improve the performance _cite_ _cite_, which can be credited to the reduction of overfitting. In this paper, we adopt quantization as a method to reduce overfitting to FCNs for accurate biomedical image segmentation. Particularly, we focus on a recent effective biomedical image segmentation framework, suggestive annotation _cite_ . We develop two new quantization processes to incorporate into this state-of-the-art framework: (N) suggestive annotation with quantization for highly representative training samples, and (N) network training with quantization for high accuracy. Extensive experiments are presented on the widely-used MICCIA Gland dataset, and the results show that our proposed method exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance by up to N \%. In addition, our method has a reduction of up to N on memory usage.
