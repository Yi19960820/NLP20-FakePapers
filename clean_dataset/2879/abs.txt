We propose approaches based on deep learning to localize objects in images when only a small training dataset is available and the images have low quality. That applies to many problems in medical image processing, and in particular to the analysis of fluoroscopic (low-dose) X-ray images, where the images have low contrast. We solve the problem by incorporating high-level information about the objects, which could be a simple geometrical model, like a circular outline, or a more complex statistical model. A simple geometrical representation can sufficiently describe some objects and only requires minimal labeling. Statistical shape models can be used to represent more complex objects. We propose computationally efficient two-stage approaches, which we call, for both representations by fitting the representation to the output of a deep segmentation network.
