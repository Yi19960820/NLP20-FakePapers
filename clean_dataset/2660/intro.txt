Retinal images are widely used to observe the eye in detail, including the retina, retinal blood vessels, the optic disc, and the vitreous body. Ophthalmologists rely heavily on these images to diagnose and treat various retinal diseases including retinal tear, retinal detachment, hemorrhaging, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. It is noninvasive and simple, no radiation or pharmaceuticals are needed, and the cost for both the equipment itself and its use is low. Retinal images are the only type of medical image that provides a clear, high resolution visualization of blood vessels in the body. Compared to other image modalities such as X-ray or CT angiography, the difference in image clarity is considerable. Thus retinal vessel analysis for early diagnosis and treatment of many chronic diseases including cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases and diabetes. Early methods mostly applied simple thresholding to hand-designed feature descriptors, as in _cite_ . As methodologies progressed, methods with more sophisticated label inference schemes, often requiring supervised learning, together with more complex hand-designed local feature descriptors~ _cite_ became more common. Vessel pixel classification methods based on supervised learning such as k-nearest neighbors~ _cite_ support vector machines (SVM) ~ _cite_ have been proposed. However, the intricacy for hand-designed feature descriptors are inevitably limited due to the limited capacity of conscience human perception. Deep learning methodologies can be summarized as a deep neural network (NN) structure~ _cite_ with weights learned by back-propagation and optimization of a loss function using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) ~ _cite_ upon a large dataset often with ground truth supervision. While the final output of the NN is the desired outcome, and has shown excellent results as in _cite_, it has been observed that the intermediate outputs of the hidden layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures provide useful features. Recent works have shown that it can be used as an effective local image feature descriptor for semantic segmentation, both for general objects~ _cite_ and retinal vessels~ _cite_ . Deep learning methods that have been developed for retinal image segmentation~ _cite_ are commonly based on CNNs that combine multi-scale features from intermediate hidden layers, with similar preprocessing and inference schemes. Given that increasing the amount of data with ground truth is extremely difficult for retinal images, since it requires painstaking effort by an expert ophthalmologist, we believe that further research is warranted about whether there is room for improvement in the CNN structure. In this paper we present an analysis of the optimal CNN structure for vessel segmentation in retinal images. First, and most importantly, we analyze the multi-scale structure, comprising downsampling by subsampling or pooling and upsampling within recent CNN structures for retinal vessel segmentation. Following our analysis we present a novel and simple multi-scale structure comprising a block layer termed scale-space approximation (SSA), which is summarized in Fig.~ _ref_ . Second, we provide comparative evaluation between different multi-scale CNN structures including U-Net~ _cite_ and Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU) ~ _cite_ which is based on VGGNet~ _cite_ . We find that incorporating residual convolutional blocks used in ResNet (Residual Network) ~ _cite_ into our proposed multi-scale CNN structure further improves accuracy. Third, we provide comparative evaluation between different numbers of layers. We also provide an ablation study regarding the combined components of the CNN configuration.
