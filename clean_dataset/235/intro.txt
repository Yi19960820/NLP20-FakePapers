Segmentation of the pancreas can be a prerequisite for computer aided diagnosis (CADx) systems that provide quantitative organ volume analysis, e.g. for diabetic patients. Accurate segmentation could also necessary for computer aided detection (CADe) methods to detect pancreatic cancer. Automatic segmentation of numerous organs in computed tomography (CT) scans is well studied with good performance for organs such as liver, heart or kidneys, where Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of _inline_eq_ N \% are typically achieved _cite_ . However, achieving high accuracies in automatic pancreas segmentation is still a challenging task. The pancreas' shape, size and location in the abdomen can vary drastically between patients. Visceral fat around the pancreas can cause large variations in contrast along its boundaries in CT (see Fig. _ref_) . Previous methods report only N \% to N \% DSCs _cite_ . Recently, the availability of large annotated datasets and the accessibility of affordable parallel computing resources via GPUs have made it feasible to train deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) for image classification. Great advances in natural image classification have been achieved _cite_ . However, deep ConvNets for semantic image segmentation have not been well studied _cite_ . Studies that applied ConvNets to medical imaging applications also show good promise on detection tasks _cite_ . In this paper, we extend and exploit ConvNets for a challenging organ segmentation problem.
