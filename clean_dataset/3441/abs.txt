The analysis of single CT slices extracted at the third lumbar vertebra (LN) has garnered significant clinical interest in the past few years, in particular in regards to quantifying sarcopenia (muscle loss) . In this paper, we propose an efficient method to automatically detect the LN slice in ND CT images. Our method works with images with a variety of fields of view, occlusions, and slice thicknesses. ND CT images are first converted into ND via Maximal Intensity Projection (MIP), reducing the dimensionality of the problem. The MIP images are then used as input to a ND fully-convolutional network to predict the LN slice locations in the form of ND confidence maps. In addition we propose a variant architecture with less parameters allowing ND confidence map prediction and slightly faster prediction time without loss of accuracy. Quantitative evaluation of our method on a dataset of \numTrainImages ND CT images yields a median error of Nmm, similar to the inter-rater median error of Nmm obtained from two annotators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in efficiently and accurately detecting the LN slice.
