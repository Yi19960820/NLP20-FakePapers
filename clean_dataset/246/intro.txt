Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are important for the prevention of vehicle accidents. ADAS contain several components, such as forward collision warning (FCW), lane departure warning (LDW), and pedestrian collision warning (PCW) systems. The PCW system is especially helpful for preventing serious damage and casualties, and as a result, many researchers and developers have tried to improve this system [N] . PCW systems usually rely on pedestrian detection and have an unfortunate tendency to produce false alarms in safe situations. For example, as shown in the image on the right side of Fig. _ref_, if pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, then an alarm is not necessary. However, traditional pedestrian detection-based PCW systems produce alerts in this situation. It is not trivial to develop a system only using hand-crafted features because it requires several complex steps, including pedestrian detection and scene recognition. In this study, using an end-to-end framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), we build a system that solves this problem. Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: There are two main advantages to our CNN-based PCW system. First, our system is effective in reducing false alarms compared to traditional pedestrian-detection-based PCW systems. Second, unlike traditional methods, our system can give warning alarms in response to cyclists as well as to pedestrians.
