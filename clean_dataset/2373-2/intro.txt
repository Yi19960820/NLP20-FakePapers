Fingerprints are widely adopted biometric patterns in forensics applications, thanks to the growing prevalence of fingerprint sensors in daily life. The retrieval and verification of fingerprints collected in the wild, however, are often negatively impacted by poor image quality. For example, the quality of fingerprint images can easily get degraded by skin dryness, wetness, wound and other types of noise. As another example, the failure of sensors will also introduce unclear or missing local fingerprint regions, which calls for completion/inpainting. In order to ease verification carried out either by humans or existing third party software, a preprocessing step of fingerprint image restoration and enhancement has shown its practical necessity. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) _cite_ have brought unprecedented success in many computer vision tasks, including some recent works addressing fingerprint extraction and analysis _cite_ . On the other hand, fingerprint restoration and enhancement have been traditionally studied using classical example-based and regression methods _cite_ . With lots of success of deep learning-based natural image denoising/inpainting/super resolution _cite_, the recent ECCV N ChaLearn competition has started to motivate researchers to develop deep learning algorithms that can restore fingerprint images that contain artifacts such as noise, scratches _cite_, etc. to improve the performance of subsequent operations like fingerprint verification that are typically applied to such images.
