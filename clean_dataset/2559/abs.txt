Humans can imagine a scene from a sound. We want machines to do so by using conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) . By applying the techniques including spectral norm, projection discriminator and auxiliary classifier, compared with naive conditional GAN, the model can generate images with better quality in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations. Almost three-fourth of people agree that our model have the ability to generate images related to sounds. By inputting different volumes of the same sound, our model output different scales of changes based on the volumes, showing that our model truly knows the relationship between sounds and images to some extent.
