Automatic classification of Human Epithelial Type-N (HEp-N) cells staining patterns is an important yet challenging problem in medicine. Although both shallow and deep classification systems have been proposed, the study of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this task is shallow to date. In this paper, a deep convolutional architecture was proposed to address the classification problem under cross-specimen evaluation. Then the effect of different data augmentation strategies was investigated on this task. Extra training data were generated from specimen images using segmentation mask and ground true bounding box. We also compared our deep framework with other methods including CNNs originally proposed for this task.
