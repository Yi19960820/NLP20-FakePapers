{{MRI quantification of cranial nerves such as anterior visual pathway (AVP) in MRI is challenging due to their thin small size, structural variation along its path, and adjacent anatomic structures}} . Segmentation of pathologically abnormal optic nerve (e.g. optic nerve glioma) poses additional challenges due to changes in its shape at unpredictable locations. In this work, we propose a partitioned joint statistical shape model approach with sparse appearance learning for the segmentation of healthy and pathological AVP. Our main contributions are: (N) optimally partitioned statistical shape models for the AVP based on regional shape variations for greater local flexibility of statistical shape model; {{(N) refinement model to accommodate pathological regions as well as areas of subtle variation by training the model using the initial segmentation obtained in (N) ;}} (N) hierarchical deformable framework to incorporate scale information in partitioned shape and appearance models. Our method, entitled PAScAL (PArtitioned Shape and Appearance Learning), was evaluated on N MRI scans (N healthy + N glioma cases) from pediatric patients (ages N-N) . {{The experimental results show that the proposed localized shape and sparse appearance-based learning approach significantly outperforms segmentation approaches in the analysis of pathological data}} .
