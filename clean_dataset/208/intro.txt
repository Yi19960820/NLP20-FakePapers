While most research about myocardial segmentation focuses on either left ventricle (LV) _cite_ or right ventricle (RV) _cite_ segmentation on ND slices, there is a great need for ND-consistent biventricular (BV) segmentation, in which LV and RV together are segmented. ND-consistent BV segmentation provides not only consistency, but also robustness on poor-quality slices (e.g. near apex) . Its output may then be used to generate complete meshes. These advantages are missing from most other methods. For example the model of _cite_ is not very capable of segmenting the slices near apex. The lack of publicly available automatic BV mesh generation tool and the success of deep learning on medical image analysis _cite_ motivate us to develop this method based on two neural networks: the former segments a single slice in the volume and the latter propagates the segmentation to the other slices. The most competitive BV myocardial segmentation methods are the automatic ones. Shape-constrained deformable models are applied on a dataset of N CT volumes in _cite_ . The chain takes Ns for a volume. In _cite_ N-chamber segmentation is performed using steerable features learned on a dataset of N annotated CT volumes. The speed is Ns per volume. The authors of _cite_ apply marginal space learning and probabilistic boosting-tree on a dataset of N annotated MRI volumes to learn to jointly delineate LV and RV. It spends about Ns on each volume. We cannot compare directly with these methods on their reported error measures due to differences in datasets. In this paper we propose an effective pipeline based on N neural networks combining the assets of ND (speed) and ND (consistency) . An original loss function is also applied for training. Our approach has the following advantages:
