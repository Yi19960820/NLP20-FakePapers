High diagnostic accuracy of image analysis pipelines requires high quality medical images. Misleading conclusions can be drawn when the original data are of low quality, in particular for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. CMR images can contain a range of image artefacts _cite_, and assessing the quality of images acquired on MR scanners is a challenging problem. Traditionally, images are visually inspected by one or more experts, and those showing an insufficient level of quality are excluded from further analysis. However, visual assessment is time consuming and prone to variability due to inter-rater and intra-rater differences. The UK Biobank is a large-scale study with all data accessible to researchers worldwide, and will eventually consist of CMR images from N, N subjects _cite_ . To maximize the research value of this and other similar datasets, automatic quality assessment tools are essential. One specific challenge in CMR is motion-related artefacts such as mistriggering, arrhythmia and breathing artefacts. These can result in temporal and/or spatial blurring of the images, which makes subsequent processing difficult _cite_ . For example, this type of artefact can lead to erroneous quantification of left ventricular (LV) volumes, which is an important indicator for cardiac functional assessment. Examples of a good quality image and an image with blurring motion artefacts are shown in Fig. _ref_ a-b for a short-axis view CINE CMR scan.
