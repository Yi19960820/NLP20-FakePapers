Spatiotemporal feature learning in videos is a fundamental problem in computer vision. This paper presents a new architecture, termed as {\em Appearance-and-Relation Network} (ARTNet), to learn video representation in an end-to-end manner. ARTNets are constructed by stacking multiple generic building blocks, called as {\em SMART}, whose goal is to simultaneously model appearance and relation from RGB input in a separate and explicit manner. Specifically, SMART blocks decouple the spatiotemporal learning module into an appearance branch for spatial modeling and a relation branch for temporal modeling. The appearance branch is implemented based on the {\em linear combination} of pixels or filter responses in each frame, while the relation branch is designed based on the {\em multiplicative interactions} between pixels or filter responses across multiple frames. We perform experiments on three action recognition benchmarks: Kinetics, UCFN, and HMDBN, demonstrating that SMART blocks obtain an evident improvement over ND convolutions for spatiotemporal feature learning. Under the same training setting, ARTNets achieve superior performance on these three datasets to the existing state-of-the-art methods.~
