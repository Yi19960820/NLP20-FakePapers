Due to the effectiveness and efficiency in object motion analysis, keypoint-based object tracking~ _cite_ is a popular and powerful tool of video processing, and thus has a wide range of applications such as augmented reality (AR), object retrieval, and video compression. By encoding the local structural information on object appearance~ _cite_, it is generally robust to various appearance changes caused by several complicated factors such as shape deformation, illumination variation, and partial occlusion~ _cite_ . Motivated by this observation, we focus on constructing effective and robust keypoint models to well model the intrinsic spatio-temporal structural properties of object appearance in this paper. Typically, keypoint model construction consists of keypoint representation and statistical modeling. For keypoint representation, a variety of keypoint descriptors are proposed to encode the local invariance information on object appearance, for example, SIFT~ _cite_ and SURF~ _cite_ . To further speed up the feature extraction process, a number of binary local descriptors emerge, including BRIEF~ _cite_, ORB~ _cite_, BRISK~ _cite_, FREAK~ _cite_, etc. Since the way of feature extraction is handcrafted and fixed all the time, these keypoint descriptors are usually incapable of effectively and flexibly adapting to complex time-varying appearance variations as tracking proceeds. In general, statistical modeling is cast as a tracking-by-detection problem, which seeks to build an object locator based on discriminative learning such as randomized decision trees~ _cite_ and boosting~ _cite_ . However, these approaches usually generate the binary classification output for object tracking, and thus ignore the intrinsic structural or geometrical information (e.g., geometric transform across frames) on object localization and matching during model learning. To address this issue, Hare {\it et al.} ~ _cite_ propose a structured SVM-based keypoint tracking approach that incorporates the RANSAC-based geometric matching information into the optimization process of learning keypoint-specific SVM models. As a result, the proposed tracking approach is able to simultaneously find correct keypoint correspondences and estimate underlying object geometric transforms across frames. In addition, the model learning process is independently carried out frame by frame, and hence ignores the intrinsic cross-frame interaction information on temporal model coherence, leading to instable tracking results in complicated scenarios. In this work, we propose a joint learning approach that is capable of well balancing the following three important parts: temporal model coherence across frames, spatial model consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. As illustrated in Figure~ _ref_, the joint learning approach ensures the temporal model coherence by building a multi-task structured model learning scheme, which encodes the cross-frame interaction information by simultaneously optimizing a set of mutually correlated learning subtasks (i.e., a common model plus different biases) over several successive frames. As a result, the interaction information induced by multi-task learning can guide the tracker to produce stable tracking results. Moreover, the proposed approach explores the keypoint-specific structural information on spatial model consistency by performing geometric verification based structured output learning, which aims to estimate a geometric transformation while associating cross-frame keypoints. In order to make the keypoint descriptors well adapt to time-varying tracking situations, the proposed approach naturally embeds metric learning to the structured SVM learning process, which enhances the discriminative power of inter-class separability. In summary, we propose a keypoint tracking approach that learns an effective and robust keypoint model through metric learning-driven multi-task structured output optimization.
