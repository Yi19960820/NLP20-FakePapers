Face recognition (FR) has gained importance in security for surveillance, which has recently attracted the attention of vision researchers. In surveillance scenarios, the problem of face recognition is difficult as the image frames captured by CCTV cameras often suffer from low illumination and distance-based attenuation factors, thus capturing poor quality images. The low quality face images coupled with low resolution produce unsatisfactory performance (accuracy) of recognition. There has been several attempts of FR to solve this problem in the recent past. Traditional FR techniques fail to cater to the changes in the resolution, contrast and illumination between the gallery and the probe samples. The proposed approach consists of three stages: (i) Pre-processing and feature-extraction, (ii) Soft-margin learning for multiple feature-kernel combinations (SML-MFKC), and (iii) Domain Adaptation (DA) . In the rest of the paper, section _ref_ details the recent advances in the field of the face detection and recognition under surveillance scenario, multiple kernel learning based classification and domain adaptation. Section _ref_ briefly outlines the proposed techniques, while the section _ref_ introduces the three real world surveillance datasets used for the evaluation of the proposed techniques. Finally, section _ref_ gives the quantitative results of performance analysis for the proposed technique, on the three datasets, using rank-N recognition rate, CMC and ROC metrics, and section _ref_ concludes the paper.
