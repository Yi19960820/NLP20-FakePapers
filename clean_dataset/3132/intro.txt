Deconvolution is an ubiquitous data processing method that arises in a variety of applications, \eg biomedical imaging~ _cite_, astronomy~ _cite_, remote sensing~ _cite_ and video and photo enhancement~ _cite_ . Formally, this problem amounts to recovering a signal _inline_eq_ from and observations _inline_eq_: where _inline_eq_ stands for the operation between _inline_eq_ and some other signal _inline_eq_, while _inline_eq_ is a general function accounting for some corrupting noise, \eg _inline_eq_ under an additive corruption model with some (Gaussian) noise _inline_eq_ . For instance, when a scene is captured by an optical instrument, the observation is a blurred or degraded version of the original image, corrupted by noise and by some effects due to the instrument (motion, out-of-focus, light scattering, ...) . In such a case, the imaging system is usually assumed to be well represented by the sensing model (_ref_) where the ideal image _inline_eq_ is blurred by a Point Spread Function (PSF) _inline_eq_ . Implicitly, the PSF describes the response of the imaging device to a Dirac point source, \ie the impulse response of the instrument, while _inline_eq_ can distinguish different sources of noise contaminating the image: read-out, photon counting, multiplicative and compression noise, among others. If the true PSF can be determined in advance, then it is possible to recover the original, undistorted image by convolving the acquired image with the inverse PSF. This is the so called \lq known-PSF deconvolution.' In most practical applications, however, finding the true PSF is impossible and an approximation must be made. As the acquired image is corrupted by various sources of noise, both the PSF and a denoised version of the image should be recovered together. This process is known as \lq blind deconvolution.' Since there are infinite combinations of image and filter that are compatible with the distorted observations, the blind deconvolution problem is severely ill-posed. One way to reduce the number of unknowns is to introduce a forward (parametric) model of the PSF. For instance, Oliveira et al.~ _cite_ have modeled the motion blur by a straight line, where the number of unknowns is reduced to two: the line length and angle. Babacan et al.~ _cite_ have modeled smoothly varying PSFs by using a simultaneous autoregressive prior, where the only parameter to estimate is the variance of a Gaussian function. However, such methods are limited to specific applications as they can only recover the expected model of the PSF, excluding the estimation of a generic non-parametric PSF. Furthermore, due to the ill-posedness of the blind deconvolution problem, a slight mismatch between the specified model and the true PSF can lead to poorly deconvolved images. Blind-deconvolution is also very sensitive to the noise present in the observations. While some works~ _cite_ have used fast and efficient techniques such as a simple inverse filtering to recover both the PSF and the undistorted image from the blurred observations, these methods present low tolerance to noise~ _cite_ . Robust blind deconvolution methods, on the other hand, optimize a data fidelity term, which is based on the acquisition model, stabilized by some additional regularization terms. If the observations are corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise, the deconvolution problem can be solved by a regularized least-squares (LS) minimization~ _cite_ . In the presence of Poisson noise, the problem can be formulated using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the data fidelity term~ _cite_, which represents a more complex function to minimize. To avoid dealing with the KL divergence, the Poisson corrupted data can also be handled through a Variance Stabilization Transform (VST) ~ _cite_ . The VST provides an approximated Gaussian noise distributed data and thus allows working with a regularized LS formulation. In this work, blind deconvolution is used to recover both the PSF and the undistorted image from blurred observations acquired by solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) telescopes. We use the proximal alternating minimization method recently proposed by Attouch et al.~ _cite_ in the context of additive Gaussian noise. This algorithm allows handling LS problems for a large amount of regularization functionals. The advantage of this method over usual alternating minimization approaches, \eg Fish et al.~ _cite_, is that it provides theoretical convergence guarantees and it is general enough to include a wide variety of prior information. To our knowledge, it is the first time that blind deconvolution is solved using the proximal algorithm of Attouch et al.~ _cite_ . In optical telescopes, the PSF originates from various instrumental effects, such as: optical aberrations (spherical, astigmatism, coma), diffraction (produced by, \eg an entrance filter mesh), scattering (from, \eg micro-roughness of the mirrors resulting in long-range diffuse illumination), charge spreading, etc. All these effects `spread' light, \ie incident photons which would otherwise focus to a single point of the focal place, may get detected at a location that is a bit shifted or even far away. This does affect different types of measurements, such as the photometry of fine features, see, \eg~ _cite_ . The PSF of solar telescopes is usually modeled using pre-flight instrument specifications~ _cite_ . After building a specific model for a given instrument, few parameters need to be estimated in order to recover the PSF. For instance, Gburek et al.~ _cite_ fitted the central pixels of the TRACE PSF to a Moffat function, while DeForest et al.~ _cite_ modeled the long-range effect of the TRACE PSF as the sum of a measured diffraction pattern with a circularly symmetric scattering profile. The PSFs from the four EUVI instrument channels on STEREO-B were studied by~Shearer et al.~ _cite_, where the long-range scattering effect was assumed to follow a parametric piece-wise power-law model. A similar method was used to estimate the PSF of the SWAP instrument on board the PROBAN satellite~ _cite_ . Finally, Poduval et al.~ _cite_ provided a semi-empiric model for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, similar to the one used by DeForest et al.~ _cite_ for TRACE. In all these works, the complete set of parameters that were fitted are in the range of five to eleven values, just a few compared to the resolution of the PSF (millions of pixels) . In addition to building a parametric model of the PSF using the specifications of the instruments, some works~ _cite_ have used the information from a celestial transit to help inferring the PSF of a given instrument. A celestial transit, shown in Figure~ _ref_, is an astronomical event where the Moon or a planet move across the disk of the sun, hiding a part of it, as seen from the telescope. Since the EUV emission of transiting celestial bodies is zero, any apparent emission is known to be caused by the instrument. Therefore, this type of event provides strong prior information that allows the regularization of the blind deconvolution problem. Let us note that all these parametric methods present the disadvantage of being specific for a given instrument and depending on a good characterization of the PSF, which is not always possible~ _cite_ . Central to our work is the information provided by the transit of a celestial object whose apparent boundary on the recorded image can be predicted with high (sub-pixel) accuracy. This is typically the case for the observation of Moon or Venus transits for which ephemeris allows us to precisely know their apparent boundaries at the recording time, provided of course that the small variations of the object topography around a perfect disk (\eg mountains, craters) are smaller than a pixel width, and, that such a transitting object has no atmosphere that could blur its apparent boundary (\eg as for an Earth transit) . As will be clear below, these hypotheses have been respected for at least two cases: for the instrument SECCHI/EUVI during the N Lunar transit and for SDO/AIA during the N Venus transit. For these two situations, and for any other transit respecting the conditions above, we know a priori the values for a set of pixels in the image and also their exact location. Our work uses such information as constraint in the function to be optimized for blindly deconvolving images. Notice that our approach could also be applied to other situations where pixel values and exact location are known a priori (\eg dark calibration patterns in Computer Vision applications) . Contrarily to previous works in solar physics, the blind deconvolution method demonstrated in this paper is not based on a specific model of the PSF, but infers it from the observed data. This allows the method to be used for estimating the PSF of any instrument provided it has a prior information on a set of pixel values. Since no model is imposed on the PSF, the large number of unknowns makes the problem computationally intractable. We thus focus on the estimation of the PSF core, which is defined as the central pixels encompassing at least _inline_eq_ of the total PSF energy. Note that this thresholding follows the radial energy characterization of the SDO/AIA PSF in the paper of Poduval et al.~ _cite_ and a similar study of the available PSFs of SECCHI/EUVI (\eg~ _cite_) . The PSF core accounts for charge spreading, optical aberrations, and diffraction effects. Note that the same algorithm would be able to handle a parametric model of the PSF provided a precise instrument characterization is available. For simplicity, we consider an average additive Gaussian noise model that gathers all sources of noise present in the observation. A detailed discussion on how to handle more general noise models is provided in Section~ _ref_ . The proposed method is first tested through simulated realistic scenarios. Results show the ability to estimate a given PSF with high quality. We also show the importance of considering multiple transit observations in order to provide a better conditioning to the filter estimation problem. We validate our method on AIA and EUVI observations using solar transits. The validation of the recovered filters is based on the reduction of the celestial body apparent emissions. The estimated PSFs were also tested for images containing active regions. Results show that, when recovering the PSF core, the proposed non-parametric scheme can achieve similar results to parametric methods. Also, we consider the case where the parametric PSF is incorporated in the imaging model as an additional filter convolving the actual image~ _cite_ . We show that the resulting parametric/non-parametric PSF provides better results than both parametric and non-parametric PSFs estimated independently. Let us note that, since parametric methods are based on the physics of the instrument, they tend to provide a more precise PSF containing both the core and the diffraction peaks. However, when the telescope presents unknown or unexpected behavior, an accurate model of the filter cannot be built. In such cases, we require non-parametric models, as the one presented in this paper, which due to their flexibility can handle better some instrument's properties. In Section~ _ref_ we describe the discrete forward model and the noise estimation. In Section~ _ref_ we present the formulation of the blind deconvolution problem based on the image and filter prior information. Section~ _ref_ describes the alternating minimization method used for estimating the filter and the image. It briefly presents the method, including the initialization, the parameter estimation, the stopping criteria and the numerical reconstruction. In Section~ _ref_ we present a non-blind deconvolution method that is used for the experimental validation. In Section~ _ref_ we present the results on both synthetic and experimental data for the AIA and EUVI telescopes. Finally, Section~ _ref_ presents a discussion of the obtained results, providing some perspectives for future research work. We denote by _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ the sets of natural, integer and real numbers, respectively. The set of the non-negative real numbers is denoted by _inline_eq_ . Most of domain dimensions are denoted by capital roman letters, \eg _inline_eq_ Vectors and matrices are associated with bold symbols, \eg _inline_eq_ or _inline_eq_, while lowercase light letters are associated with scalar values. The _inline_eq_ component of a vector _inline_eq_ reads either _inline_eq_ or _inline_eq_, while the vector _inline_eq_ may refer to the _inline_eq_ element of a vector set. The vector of ones in _inline_eq_ is denoted by _inline_eq_ . The set of indices in _inline_eq_ is _inline_eq_ . The support of a vector _inline_eq_ is defined as _inline_eq_ . The cardinality of a set _inline_eq_, measuring the number of elements of the set, is denoted by _inline_eq_ . The convolution between two vectors _inline_eq_ for some dimension _inline_eq_ is denoted equivalently by _inline_eq_ . We denote _inline_eq_ the class of proper, convex and lower-semicontinuous functions from a finite dimensional vector space _inline_eq_ (\eg _inline_eq_) to _inline_eq_ ~ _cite_ . The (convex) indicator function _inline_eq_ of the set _inline_eq_ is equal to _inline_eq_ if _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ otherwise. The N-D discrete delta function, denoted as _inline_eq_, is equal to N if _inline_eq_, and _inline_eq_ otherwise. The transposition of a matrix _inline_eq_ reads _inline_eq_ . For any _inline_eq_, the _inline_eq_-norm of _inline_eq_ is _inline_eq_ . The Frobenius norm of _inline_eq_ is given by _inline_eq_ . The Gaussian distribution of mean _inline_eq_ and variance _inline_eq_ is denoted by _inline_eq_ .
