Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease which may appear in early life with structural abnormalities in lung tissues. We propose to detect these abnormalities using a texture classification approach. Our method is a cascade of two convolutional neural networks. The first network detects the presence of abnormal tissues. The second network identifies the type of the structural abnormalities: bronchiectasis, atelectasis or mucus plugging.We also propose a network computing pixel-wise heatmaps of abnormality presence learning only from the patch-wise annotations. Our database consists of CT scans of N subjects. We use N subjects to train our algorithms and the N remaining ones as a test set. We compare our method with random forest and a single neural network approach. The first network reaches an accuracy of N, N for disease detection, N, N higher than the random forest classifier and N, N higher than the single neural network. Our cascade approach yields a final class-averaged FN-score of N, N, outperforming the baseline method and the single network by N, N and N, N .
