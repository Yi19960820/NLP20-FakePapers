The task of human pose estimation is to determine the precise pixel locations of body keypoints from a single input image _cite_ . Human pose estimation is very important for many high-level computer vision tasks, including action and activity recognition, human-computer interaction, motion capture, and animation. Estimating human poses from natural images is quite challenging. An effective pose estimation system must be able to handle large pose variations, changes in clothing and lighting conditions, severe body deformations, heavy body occlusions _cite_ . It is naturally a regression task. With Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and many assistive methods such as batch normalization _cite_, resnet _cite_, and inception design _cite_, single-person human pose estimation has recently achieved significant progress. Recent research emphasis has been put on multi-person human pose estimation, where multiple individuals may exist in a natural scene. Compared to single person human pose estimation, where human candidates are cropped and centered in the image patch, the task of multi-person human pose estimation is more challenging. The best performance on MS COCO N Keypoints challenge _cite_ is only around N \% in mean average precision (mAP) . Existing methods can be classified into two kinds of approaches, the top-down approach and the bottom-up approach. The top-down approach _cite_ relies on a detection module to obtain human candidates and then apply a single-person human pose estimator to detect human keypoints. The bottom-up approach _cite_, on the other hand, detects human keypoints from all potential human candidates and then assemble these keypoints into human limbs for each individual based on various data association techniques. The main advantage of the bottom-up approaches is its excellent tradeoff between estimation accuracy and computational cost. It takes the winner _cite_ of MS COCO N keypoint challenge less than N ms to run the pose estimator for one frame on a Pascal TITAN X GPU. More importantly, contrary to top-down approaches, its computational cost is invariant to the number of human candidates in the image. We follow the bottom-up approach of the works of Zhe. et. al _cite_ and aim to design smaller, faster, and more accurate neural networks for multi-person keypoints regression. According to _cite_, their proposed Part Affinity Fields (PAF) and its corresponding data-association techniques are robust and reliable. More accurate keypoint and PAF regression would potentially increase the overall performance up to N \%. In this work, we focus on the network regression part and leave the data association part to future works. We propose a dual-path network specially designed for multi-person human pose estimation, and compare our performance with the openpose _cite_ network in aspects of model size, forward speed, and estimation accuracy. Our contributions include: (N) We analyze the tasks of keypoint regression and PAF, where PAF estimation depends heavily on keypoints estimation but not vice versa. (N) We then design a dual-path network, the denseNet path responsible for PAF regression while the resNeXt path regressing human keypoints. Our performance is superior than the openpose _cite_ network even though the proposed network is of lower computational complexity and smaller model size. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section _ref_, we provide a brief review of recent works on multi-person human pose estimation. Section _ref_ introduces the proposed network. Section _ref_ presents our experimental results. Section _ref_ concludes our paper.
