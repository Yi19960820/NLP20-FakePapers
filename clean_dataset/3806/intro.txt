Segmentation and localization of retinal blood vessels serve as an important cue for the diagnosis of opthalmological diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, microaneurysms and arteriochlerosis~ _cite_ . However, manual segmentation of blood vessels is both tedious and time consuming. Thus, the focus of this paper is on automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels from fundus images. The task of automatic segmentation of blood vessels is challenging due to their abrupt variations in branching patterns. This task becomes even more challenging due the presence of noisy background and tortuosity. Related Work: Previous attempts of blood vessels segmentation can be broadly divided into two categories. The first group used unsupervised methods which includes vessel tracking~ _cite_, adaptive thresholding~ _cite_, and morphology based techniques~ _cite_ etc. The second group utilized the supervised machine learning algorithms which make use of hand-labeled images (i.e. ground truth) for learning models. Most of the supervised methods extract hand-crafted features e.g. ridge features, Gabor at different scales and degrees etc. from the fundus images and classify them using Nearest Neighbour, Bayesian, Gaussian Mixture Models, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks or their variants ~ _cite_ . Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has gained a lot of interest due to their highly discriminative representations that has outperformed many state-of-the-art techniques in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, it has also attracted medical imaging research community. In N, Liskowski et al.~ _cite_ proposed a deep convolutional neural network architecture for vessel segmentation in fundus images. Maji et al.~ _cite_ proposed an ensemble of N deep convolutional neural networks and take the mean of the outputs of all networks as the final decision. Lahiri et al.~ _cite_ proposed an architecture which is based on an ensemble of stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) . The final decision is the combination of all SDAEs outputs passed through a softmax layer. Contribution: In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network architecture for blood vessel segmentation. As suggested by~ _cite_, we formulate the vessel segmentation problem as a multi-label inference problem which is learnt by joint loss function. In this way, we can learn about the class label dependencies of neighboring pixels which play an important role in segmentation of anatomical structures. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to leverage the combined advantage of fully convolutional neural network and structured prediction approach for retinal blood vessel segmentation in fundus images. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section _ref_ defines the problem statement more formally and describes the proposed methodology in detail. In Section _ref_ we show the experimental results on publicly available DRIVE~ _cite_ dataset which validate our claims. Finally, in Section _ref_ we conclude our paper with a summary of our proposed methodology and future scope.
