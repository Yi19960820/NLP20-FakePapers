Diabetes is a chronic illness characterised by the absence of glucose homeostasis. A healthy pancreas dynamically controls the release of insulin and glucagon hormones through the _inline_eq_-cells and _inline_eq_-cells respectively, in order to maintain euglycaemia _cite_ . In Type N diabetes, an autoimmune disease, the _inline_eq_-cells are compromised and therefore suffer from impaired production of insulin. This leads to periods of hyperglycaemia (persistent blood glucose (BG) concentration _inline_eq_) and hypoglycaemia ({BG} concentration _inline_eq_) _cite_ . Insulin therapy is needed to maintain {BG} levels in the advised target range _cite_ . The standard approach to diabetes management requires people actively taking {BG} measurements a handful of times throughout the day with a finger prick test-self monitoring of blood glucose. The recent development and uptake of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices allow for improved sampling (N minutes) of glucose measurements {_cite_} . {This approach has proven to be effective in controlling BG and thus improving the outcome of subjects in clinical trials _cite_ . Further improvement of glucose control can be realised through prediction, which allows users to take actions ahead of time in order to minimise the occurrence of adverse glycaemic events. The challenges lie in multiple factors that influence glucose variability, such as insulin variability, ingested meals, stress and other physical activities _cite_ .} In addition, {individual glycaemic responses are conditioned by high subject variability _cite_, leading to different responses between individuals under the same conditions.} {Machine learning (ML) allows intelligent systems to build appropriate models by learning and extracting patterns in data. The models discover mappings from the representation of input data to the output. Performances of traditional machine learning algorithms} such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours _cite_, or support vector regression _cite_ heavily rely on the representation of the data they are given. {Typically, the features-information the representation comprises-are engineered with prior knowledge and statistical features (mean, variance) _cite_, principal component analysis (PCA) _cite_ or linear discriminant analysis _cite_ .} Artificial neural networks (ANN) are also investigated widely in diabetes management _cite_ . {One advantage of ANN is that, normally no handcraft feature finding is required.} {However, ANN in the literature are mostly implemented fewer than N layers, hence its learning capacity is limited due to the model complexity.} {Deep learning, which incorporates multi-layer neural networks, has lead to significant progresses in computer vision _cite_, diseases diagnosis _cite_, and healthcare _cite_ . Deep learning shows superior performance to traditional ML techniques due to this ability to automatically learn features with higher complexity and representations _cite_ . As a result, it encodes features that might not be previously known to researchers.} In this paper, we propose a deep learning algorithm for glucose prediction using a multi-layer convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture. The model is primarily trained on data comprising CGM, carbohydrate and insulin data. After preprocessing, the time-aligned multi-dimensional time series data of BG, carbohydrate and insulin (other factors also can be considered) are fed to {CRNN} for training. The architecture of the CRNN is composed of three parts: a multi-layer convolutional neural network that extracts the data features using convolution and pooling, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer with long short term memory (LSTM) cells and fully-connected layers. {The model is trained end-to-end. The convolutional layer comprises a ND Gaussian kernel filter to perform the temporal convolution, and pooling layers are used for reducing the feature set.} A variant of LSTM model is leveraged since LSTM shows good performances in predicting time series with long time dependencies _cite_ . The final output is a regression output by fully connected layers. {The CRNN model} is realized using the open-source software library Tensorflow _cite_, and it can be easily implemented to portable devices with its simplified version Tensorflow Lite. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on datasets of simulated cases as well as clinical cases of TNDM subjects, and compared against {benchmark} algorithms including support vector regression (SVR) _cite_, the latent variable model (LVX) _cite_, the autoregressive model (ARX) _cite_, and neural network for predicting glucose algorithm (NNPG) _cite_ . The results show the competitive performance of the method. {As far as we know, the proposed method is a pioneering work in glucose forecast implementing deep neural networks that incorporates the merits of both CNN and RNN, and we modify them to suit the task of glucose prediction. It achieves competitive performances in terms of forecasting accuracy comparing to benchmark methods, with superior performances in terms of RMSE. It applies multi-layer NN in smart phones with applications in diabetes management. The paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly introduces the properties of the glucose data. Section III addresses the method and architecture of the proposed convolutional recurrent neural network. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and discussed in Section IV. Section V discusses important details of the method. Finally Section VI summaries the paper.}
