In past few years, connectomics has grown to become a mature field of study in neuroscience. Reconstruction of neural circuits from Electron Microscopic (EM) images of animal brain is not a hypothetical concept anymore--multiple attempts in this field have already furnished the neuroscience community with wiring diagrams from different animals~ _cite_ . These studies, and others e.g., ~ _cite_, report crucial biological discoveries stemming from the computed wiring diagrams. While electron microscopy is capable of providing the most exhaustive knowledge about the cellular anatomy and connectivity among all other imaging techniques, it also produces an enormous amount of data that is too large to process manually. All the aforementioned works adopt a semi-automated strategy where the results of automated algorithms are manually corrected afterwards. Extraction of neural shapes entails a ND segmentation of EM data volume, i.e., tracing of cellular processes within and across different sections/planes of the EM volume. With the same resolution in all x, y, z dimensions, isotropic images can capture the continuity in z dimension (or in depth) more than other imaging approaches. In an isotropic EM volume, a cellular process almost never overlaps (to a significant extent) with that from another neuron across different sections. This characteristic of isotropic recording offers a fundamental advantage for the automatic ND segmentation methods. Another benefit of the isotropic, or near isotropic, imaging techniques such as FIBSEM~ _cite_ and SBEM~ _cite_ is that they typically give rise to little or no staining and imaging artifacts. Not surprisingly, most of the successful efforts for neural reconstruction were performed on isotropic or near isotropic data. SBEM has a voxel resolution of _inline_eq_ nm in x, y, z respectively which we consider to be very close to being isotropic for practical reconstruction purposes. The success of these efforts can be largely contributed to the progress in the ND segmentation algorithms that have been developed recently~ _cite_ . In addition to the improved methods, the profound improvement in automatic processing accuracy in the studies of _cite_, that led to more than N times speed up in overall reconstruction time compared to ~ _cite_, can also be partially attributed to the transition to isotropic FIBSEM images. However, isotropic imaging has its limitations. FIBSEM, for example, is not ideal for large scale imaging in the range of several hundreds cubic microns~ _cite_ . There have been experiments~ _cite_ for scaling up the volume that FIBSEM can capture successfully, but have not yet delivered a large scale connectome. On the other hand, anisotropic approaches such as MSEM~ _cite_ are capable of imaging volume in cubic millimeter scale and therefore is suitable for large scale connectomics. Anisotropic imaging records images from tissue sections thicker than those isotropic methods (e.g., FIBSEM) can capture. While this strategy enlarges the brain region that can be captured by the same volume of data, it decreases the continuity in z dimension significantly. As a result, the area that pertains to one cellular process on any particular plane can overlap with multiple processes across different planes. This gives an additional challenge to the segmentation process--without an additional mechanism specifically designed to handle such situation, applying ND segmentation in a straightforward fashion will inaccurately merge many neurons into one large body. Perhaps a natural idea to operate on this data is to apply ND segmentation on each section~ _cite_ and then link the ND segments on different sections with a linkage or cosegmentation algorithm~ _cite_ . However, as the results from the EM segmentation challenges SNEMI (_url_), CREMI (_url_) and many experiments across different research groups suggest, such an approach typically lead to a level of over-segmentation that is not very favorable for efficient reconstruction. Our observation indicates that if the input over-segmentation is largely fragmented or under-segmented, one cannot expect a high quality solution from these algorithms despite their solid conceptual and theoretical foundation. It appears to us that generating the initial over-segmentation remains a challenge for the anisotropic EM volumes. In this paper, we present a method to compute a ND over-segmentation of anisotropic data by learning ND affinities directly using a deep neural network. Given such an input over-segmentation we apply the agglomeration method of~ _cite_ to generate the final segmentation results. We train a ND U-net~ _cite_ using MALIS~ _cite_ loss to predict the ND affinities in _inline_eq_ dimensions. This particular loss function emphasizes on learning the sparse locations that are more important than other to preserve neuron topology rather than imposing equal weight on all pixels. In addition to~ _cite_, multiple other studies~ _cite_ demonstrated the importance on training at sparse topologically important locations for EM connectomics. In addition, the experiments in ~ _cite_ and~ _cite_ suggests that agglomerative clustering can achieve equivalent or better segmentation accuracy than linkage algorithms~ _cite_ given a ND over-segmentation with minimal or no false merges. Extensive experiments on multiple anisotropic dataset exhibit superior performance of the ND affinity learning and agglomeration compared to standard methods. The proposed method produces impressive improvement over the existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively as we report them in the result section. Another study by Funke et.al. also reports similar findings independently on different datasets. This approach uses a different agglomeration technique as well, however the quality of their segmentation is also very impressive.
