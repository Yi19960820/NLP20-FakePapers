learning (DL) ~ _cite_ is a branch of machine learning algorithms that aims at learning the hierarchical representations of data. Deep learning has shown prominent superiority over other machine learning algorithms in many artificial intelligence domains, such as computer vision~ _cite_, speech recognition~ _cite_, and natural language processing~ _cite_ . Generally, the strong capacity of DL to address substantial unstructured data is attributable to two main contributors: the development of efficient computing hardware and the advancement of sophisticated algorithms. Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a notoriously challenging ill-posed problem because a specific low-resolution (LR) input can correspond to a crop of possible high-resolution (HR) images, and the HR space (in most instances, it refers to the natural image space) that we intend to map the LR input to is usually intractable~ _cite_ . Previous methods for SISR mainly have two drawbacks: one is the unclear definition of the mapping that we aim to develop between the LR space and the HR space, and the other is the inefficiency of establishing a complex high-dimensional mapping given massive raw data. Benefiting from the strong capacity of extracting effective high-level abstractions that bridge the LR and HR space, recent DL-based SISR methods have achieved significant improvements, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In this survey, we attempt to give an overall review of recent DL-based SISR algorithms. We mainly focus on two areas: efficient neural network architectures designed for SISR and effective optimization objectives for DL-based SISR learning. The reason for this taxonomy is that when we apply DL algorithms to tackle a specified task, it is best for us to consider both the universal DL strategies and the specific domain knowledge. From the perspective of DL, although many other techniques such as data preprocessing~ _cite_ and model training techniques are also quite important~ _cite_, the combination of DL and domain knowledge in SISR is usually the key to success and is often reflected in the innovations of neural network architectures and optimization objectives for SISR. In each of these two focused areas, based on the benchmark, several representative works are discussed mainly from the perspective of their contributions and experimental results as well as our comments and views. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section~ _ref_, we present relevant background concepts of SISR and DL. In Section~ _ref_, we survey the literature on exploring efficient neural network architectures for various SISR tasks. In Section~ _ref_, we survey the studies on proposing effective objective functions for different purposes. In Section~ _ref_, we summarize some trends and challenges for DL-based SISR. We conclude this survey in Section~ _ref_ .
