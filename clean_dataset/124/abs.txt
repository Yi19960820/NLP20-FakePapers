Existing approaches towards single image dehazing including both model-based and learning-based heavily rely on the estimation of so-called transmission maps. Despite its conceptual simplicity, using transmission maps as an intermediate step often makes it more difficult to optimize the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. To overcome this weakness, we propose a direct deep learning approach toward image dehazing bypassing the step of transmission map estimation and facilitating end-to-end perceptual optimization. Our technical contributions are mainly three-fold. First, based on the analogy between dehazing and denoising, we propose to directly learn a nonlinear mapping from the space of degraded images to that of haze-free ones via recursive deep residual learning; Second, inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of dehazed images by introducing a discriminator and a loss function adaptive to hazy conditions; Third, we propose to remove notorious halo-like artifacts at large scene depth discontinuities by a novel application of guided filtering. Extensive experimental results have shown that the subjective qualities of dehazed images by the proposed perceptually optimized GAN (POGAN) are often more favorable than those by existing state-of-the-art approaches especially when hazy condition varies.
