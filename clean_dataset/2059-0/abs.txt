We propose a new deep learning based framework to identify pedestrians, and caution distracted drivers, in an effort to prevent the loss of life and property. This framework uses two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), one which detects pedestrians and the second which predicts the onset of drowsiness in a driver, is implemented on a Raspberry Pi N Model B +, shows great promise. The algorithm for implementing such a low-cost, low-compute model is presented and the results discussed.
