the increasing demand for multimedia content, there has been more and more interest in visual data acquisition. Many visual data, such as Lidar depth map, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) image, XRF image, etc, is acquired by the time consuming raster scan process. Thus sampling techniques need to be investigated to speed up the acquisition process. Compressed sensing (CS) has shown that it is possible to acquire and reconstruct natural images under the Nyquist sampling rates _cite_ . Rather than full image acquisition followed by compression, CS combines sensing and compression into one step, and has the advantages of faster acquisition time, smaller power consumption, and lighter data throughput. Adaptive image sampling is a sub-problem of CS that aims for a sparse representation of signals in the image domain. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive image sampling algorithm based on Deep Learning and show its application to RGB image sampling and recovery. We also applied the proposed adaptive sampling technique to speed up the raster scan process of XRF imaging, based on the correlation between RGB and XRF signals. Irregular sampling techniques have long been studied in the image processing and computer graphics fields to achieve compact representation of images. Such irregular sampling techniques, such as stochastic sampling~ _cite_, may have better anti-aliasing performance compared to uniform sampling intervals if frequencies greater than the Nyquist limit are present. Further performance improvement can be obtained if the sampling distribution is not only irregular but also adaptive to the signal itself. The limited samples should be concentrated in parts of the image rich in detail, so as to simulate human vision~ _cite_ . Several works have been reported in the literature on adaptive sampling techniques. An early significant work in this direction is made by Eldar et al. ~ _cite_ . A farthest point strategy is proposed which permits progressive and adaptive sampling of an image. Later, Rajesh et al. ~ _cite_ proposed a progressive image sampling technique inspired by the lifting scheme of wavelet generation. A similar method is developed by Demaret et al. ~ _cite_ by utilizing an adaptive thinning algorithm. Ramponi et al. ~ _cite_ developed an irregular sampling method based on a measure of the local sample skewness. Lin et al. ~ _cite_ viewed grey scale images as manifolds with density and sampled them according to the generalized Ricci curvature. Liu et al. ~ _cite_ proposed an adaptive progressive image acquisition algorithm based on kernel construction. {Recently, Taimori et al. ~ _cite_ investigated adaptive image sampling approaches based on the space-frequency-gradient information content of image patches.} Most of these irregular sampling and adaptive sampling techniques~ _cite_ need their own specific reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the fully sampled signal. Furthermore, all these sampling techniques are model-based approaches relying on predefined priors, and according to our knowledge, no work has been done on utilizing machine learning techniques to design the adaptive sampling mask. Inspired by the recent successes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ~ _cite_ in high level computer vision tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) emerged in addressing low level computer vision tasks as well~ _cite_ . For the task of image inpainting, Pathak et al. ~ _cite_ presented an auto-encoder to perform context-based image inpainting. The inpainting performance is improved by introducing perceptual loss~ _cite_ and on-demand learning~ _cite_ . Iliadis et al. ~ _cite_ utilized a deep-fully-connected network for video compressive sensing while also learning an optimal binary sampling mask~ _cite_ . However, the learned optimal binary sampling mask is not adaptive to the input video signals. According to our knowledge, no work has been made on generating the adaptive binary sampling mask for the image inpainting problem using deep learning. With the proposed adaptive sampling algorithm, we can efficiently sample points based on the local structure of the input images. Besides the application of Progressive Image Transmission (PIT) ~ _cite_, compressed image sampling, image coding~ _cite_, etc., we also show that the proposed adaptive sampling algorithm can speed up many raster scan processes such as XRF imaging. In detail, the binary sampling mask can be obtained using one modality (RGB image for example) of the target, and then applied on the raster scan process for another modality (XRF image for example) . A detailed introduction to XRF imaging is in Section~ _ref_ . The contribution of this paper lies in the following aspects: This paper is organized as follows: Section~ _ref_ introduces XRF imaging with adaptive sampling. We illustrate the adaptive sampling mask design in Section~ _ref_ . We describe the XRF image inpainting problem in Section~ _ref_ . In Section~ _ref_, we provide the experimental results with both synthetic data and real data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper is concluded in Section~ _ref_ .
