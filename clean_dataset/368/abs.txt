Multi-class segmentation of vertebrae is a non-trivial task mainly due to the high correlation in the appearance of adjacent vertebrae. Hence, such a task calls for the consideration of both global and local context. Based on this motivation, we propose a two-staged approach that, given a computed tomography dataset of the spine, segments the five lumbar vertebrae and simultaneously labels them. The first stage employs a multi-layered perceptron performing non-linear regression for locating the lumbar region using the global context. The second stage, comprised of a fully-convolutional deep network, exploits the local context in the localised lumbar region to segment and label the lumbar vertebrae in one go. Aided with practical data augmentation for training, our approach is highly generalisable, capable of successfully segmenting both healthy and abnormal vertebrae (fractured and scoliotic spines) . We consistently achieve an average Dice coefficient of over N \% on a publicly available dataset of the xVertSeg segmentation challenge of MICCAI`N. This is particularly noteworthy because the xVertSeg dataset is beset with severe deformities in the form of vertebral fractures and scoliosis.
