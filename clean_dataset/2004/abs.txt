We propose a novel ND neural network architecture for ND hand pose estimation from a single depth image. Different from previous works that mostly run on ND depth image domain and require intermediate or post process to bring in the supervision from ND space, we convert the depth map to a ND volumetric representation, and feed it into a ND convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly produce the pose in ND requiring no further process. Our system does not require the ground truth reference point for initialization, and our network architecture naturally integrates both local feature and global context in ND space. To increase the coverage of the hand pose space of the training data, we render synthetic depth image by transferring hand pose from existing real image datasets. We evaluation our algorithm on two public benchmarks and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The synthetic hand pose dataset will be available.
