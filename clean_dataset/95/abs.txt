We present novel method for image-text multi-modal representation learning. In our knowledge, this work is the first approach of applying adversarial learning concept to multi-modal learning and not exploiting image-text pair information to learn multi-modal feature. We only use category information in contrast with most previous methods using image-text pair information for multi-modal embedding. In this paper, we show that multi-modal feature can be achieved without image-text pair information and our method makes more similar distribution with image and text in multi-modal feature space than other methods which use image-text pair information. And we show our multi-modal feature has universal semantic information, even though it was trained for category prediction. Our model is end-to-end backpropagation, intuitive and easily extended to other multi-modal learning work.
