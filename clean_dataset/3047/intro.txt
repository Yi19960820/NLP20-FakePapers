Segmentation of the pancreas is an important input for many computer aided diagnosis (CADx) systems that could provide quantitative analysis, e.g. for diabetic patients. Accurate segmentation could also be necessary for other computer aided detection (CADe) methodologies that aim to detect pancreatic cancer. The literature is rich for the automatic segmentation of numerous organs in CT scans with sensitivities larger N \%, especially for organs such as liver, heart or kidneys. However, high accuracy in the automatic segmentation of the pancreas is a challenging task. The pancreas' shape, size and location in the abdomen can vary drastically from patient to patient. Visceral fat tissue around the pancreas can cause large variations in contrast along its boundaries in CT. These factors make accurate and robust segmentation of the pancreas challenging. Figure _ref_ illustrates the noted challenges with a CT slice and ground-truth pancreas segmentation that was established manually by an experienced radiologist (gold standard) . We aim to replicate these segmentations using computer vision and medical image computing techniques.
