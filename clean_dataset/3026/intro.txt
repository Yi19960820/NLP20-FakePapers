The human eye is distinguished from commercially available electronic cameras by virtue of having much better resolution in the fovea near the optical axis. The eccentricity of the retina, which produces a large field of view and high acuity at the fovea, causes the human visual system to have quick jerky eye movements-i.e., saccades. It was shown that an artificial visual system equipped with saccades could reduce the number of processing units required for pattern recognition _cite_ and could greatly simplify the calculations in low-level vision systems _cite_ . The saccades involve two subtasks; i.e., a location task and an identification task. The location task fixates the location of a pattern in a wide field of view using knowledge of the pattern class of interest. On the other hand, the identification task determines the class of a pattern under the assumption that the location of the pattern can be fixated. These subtasks are therefore cooperative. Recently, Hopfield and his colleagues have shown that a symmetric interconnected neural network (a Hopfield neural network) can perform error corrections in associative retrieval _cite_ and lead to appropriate solutions in optimization problems _cite_ . In this letter, we treat the saccades as the optimization problem and apply the Hopfield network to the emulation of saccades. Computer simulation confirms that the network performs these subtasks cooperatively. It also suggests that the network is applicable to shift-invariant pattern recognition.
