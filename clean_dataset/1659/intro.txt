(US) medical imaging has the advantages of being noninvasive, harmless, cost-effective and portable over other imaging modalities such as X-ray Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging _cite_ . Despite its intrinsic rapidity of acquisition, several US applications such as cardiac, Doppler, elastography or ND imaging may require higher frame rates than those provided by conventional acquisition schemes (e.g. ultrafast imaging _cite_) or may suffer from the high amount of acquired data. In this context, a few research teams have recently evaluated the application of compressive sampling (CS) to ND and ND US imaging (e.g. _cite_) or to duplex Doppler _cite_ . CS is a mathematical framework allowing to recover, via non linear optimization routines, an image from few linear measurements (below the limit standardly imposed by the Shannon-Nyquist theorem) _cite_ . The CS acquisition model is given by where _inline_eq_ corresponds to the _inline_eq_ compressed measurements of the image _inline_eq_ (one US radiofrequency (RF) image in our case), _inline_eq_ represents the CS acquisition matrix composed for example of _inline_eq_ random Gaussian vectors with _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ stands for a zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise. \IEEEpubidadjcol The CS theory demonstrates that the _inline_eq_ pixels of image _inline_eq_ may be recovered from the _inline_eq_ measurements in _inline_eq_ provided two conditions: i) the image must have a sparse representation in a known basis or frame and ii) the measurement matrix and spasifying basis must be incoherent _cite_ . In US imaging, despite the difficulties of sparsifying the data because of the speckle noise, it has been shown that RF images may be recovered in basis such as ND Fourier _cite_, wavelets _cite_, waveatoms _cite_ or learning dictionaries _cite_, considering Bernoulli Gaussian _cite_ or _inline_eq_-stable statistical assumptions _cite_ and using various acquisition schemes such as plane-wave _cite_, Xampling _cite_ or projections on Gaussian _cite_ or Bernoulli random vectors _cite_ . However, the existing methods of CS in US have been shown to be able to recover images with a quality at most equivalent to those acquired using standard schemes. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution, the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast of standard US images (_inline_eq_ in eq.) are affected by the limited bandwidth of the imaging transducer, the physical phenomenon related to US wave propagation such as the diffraction and the imaging system. In order to overcome these issues, one of the research tracks extensively explored in the literature is the deconvolution of US images _cite_ . Based on the first order Born approximation, these methods assume that the US RF images follow a ND convolution model between the point spread function (PSF) and the tissue reflectivity function (TRF), i.e. the image to be recovered _cite_ . Specifically, this results in _inline_eq_, where _inline_eq_ is a block circulant with circulant block (BCCB) matrix related to the ND PSF of the system and _inline_eq_ represents the lexicographically ordered tissue reflectivity function. We emphasize that this convolution model is based on the assumption of spatially invariant PSF. Although the PSF of an ultrasound system varies spatially and mostly in the axial direction of the images, many settings of the ultrasound imaging system allow to attenuate this spatial variation in practice, such as the dynamic focalization of the received echoes, the multiple focusing in emission and the time gain compensation (TGC) . For this reason, the PSF is considered spatially invariant in our work, as it is the case in part of the existing works on image deconvolution in ultrasound imaging (e.g. _cite_) . The objective of our paper is to propose a novel technique which is able to jointly achieve US data volume reduction and image quality improvement. In other words, the main idea is to combine the two frameworks of CS and deconvolution applied to US imaging, resulting in the so-called compressive deconvolution (or CS deblurring) problem _cite_ . The combined direct model of joint CS and deconvolution is as follows: where the variables _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ have the same meaning as defined above. Inverting the model in will allow us to estimate the TRF _inline_eq_ from the compressed RF measurements _inline_eq_ . To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt of addressing the compressive deconvolution problem in US imaging. In the general-purpose image processing literature, a few methods have been already proposed aiming at solving _cite_ . In _cite_, the authors assumed _inline_eq_ was sparse in the direct or image domain and the PSF was unknown. In _cite_, a study on the number of measurements lower bound is presented, together with an algorithm to estimate the PSF and _inline_eq_ alternatively. The authors in _cite_ solved the compressive deconvolution problem using an _inline_eq_-norm minimization algorithm by making use of the "all-pole" model of the autoregressive process. In _cite_, _inline_eq_ was considered sparse in a transformed domain and the PSF was supposed known. An algorithm based on Poisson singular integral and iterative curvelet thresholding was shown in _cite_ . The authors in _cite_ further combined the curvelet regularization with total variation to improve the performance in _cite_ . Finally, the methods in _cite_ supposed the blurred signal _inline_eq_ was sparse in a transformed domain and the PSF unknown. They proposed a compressive deconvolution framework that relies on a constrained optimization technique allowing to exploit existing CS reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we propose a compressive deconvolution technique adapted to US imaging. Our solution is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) _cite_ and exploits two constraints. The first one, inspired from CS, imposes via an _inline_eq_-norm the sparsity of the RF image _inline_eq_ in the transformed domain (Fourier domain, wavelet domain, etc) . The second one imposes a priori information for the TRF _inline_eq_ . Gaussian and Laplacian statistics have been extensively explored in US imaging (see e.g. _cite_ . Moreover, recent results show that the Generalized Gaussian Distributed (GGD) is well adapted to model the TRF. Consequently, we employ herein the minimization of an _inline_eq_-norm of _inline_eq_, covering all possible cases ranging from N to N _cite_ . Similar to all existing frameworks, we consider the CS sampling matrix _inline_eq_ known. In US imaging, the PSF is unknown in practical applications. However, its estimation from the RF data as an initialization step for the deconvolution has been extensively explored in US imaging. In this paper, we adopted the approach in _cite_ in order to estimate the PSF further used to construct the matrix _inline_eq_ . This paper is organized as follows. In section _ref_, we formulate our problem as a convex optimization routine and propose an ADMM-based method to efficiently solve it. Supporting simulated and experimental results are provided in section _ref_ showing the contribution of our approach compared to existing methods and its efficiency in recovering the TRF from compressed US data. The conclusions are drawn in _ref_ .
