Brain Gliomas represent N \% of all malignant brain tumors. Gliomas can be categorized according to their grade which is determined by a pathologic evaluation of the tumor: Brain gliomas can be well detected using magnetic resonance imaging. The whole tumor is visible in TN-FLAIR, the tumor core is visible in TN and the enhancing tumor structures as well as the necrotic parts can be visualized using contrast enhanced TN scans. An example is illustrated in figure _ref_ . Automatic segmentation of brain tumor structures is particularly important in order to quantitatively assess the tumor geometry. It has also a great potential for surgical planning and intraoperative surgical resection guidance. Automatic segmentation still poses many challenges because of the variability of appearances and sizes of the tumors. Moreover the differences in the image acquisition protocols, the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and partial volume effects have also a great impact on the image quality obtained from routinely acquired ND MR images. In the recent years, deep neural networks have shown to provide state-of-the-art performance for various challenging image segmentation and classification problems _cite_ . Medical image segmentation problems have also been successfully tackled by such approaches _cite_ . Inspired by these works, we present here a relatively simple architecture that produces competitive results for the BRATS N dataset _cite_ . We propose a variant of the well known U-net _cite_, fed with multiscale inputs _cite_, having residual connections _cite_, and being trained in a multiscale deep supervised manner _cite_ .
