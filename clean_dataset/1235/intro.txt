Object parts play a crucial role in many recent approaches for fine-grained recognition. They allow for capturing very localized discriminative features of an object~ _cite_ . Learning part models is often either done in a completely supervised manner by providing part annotations~ _cite_ or labeled bounding boxes~ _cite_ . In contrast, we show how to learn part-models in a completely unsupervised manner, which drastically reduces annotation costs for learning. Our approach is based on learning constellations of neural activation patterns obtained from pre-learned convolutional neural networks (CNN) . Fig.~ _ref_ shows an overview of our approach. Our part hypotheses are outputs of an intermediate CNN layer for which we compute neural activation maps~ _cite_ . Unsupervised part models are either build by randomly selecting a subset of the part hypotheses or learned by estimating the parameters of a generative spatial part model. In the latter case, we implicitly find subsets of part hypotheses that ``fire'' consistently in a certain constellation in the images. Although creating a model for the spatial relationship of parts has already been introduced a decade ago~ _cite_, these approaches face major difficulties due to the fact that part proposals are based on hand-engineered local descriptors and detectors without correspondence We overcome this problem by using implicit part detectors of a pre-learned CNN, which at the same time greatly simplifies the part-model training. As shown by _cite_, intermediate CNN outputs can often be linked to semantic parts of common objects and we are therefore using them as part proposals. Our part model learning has to select only a few parts for each view of an object from an already high quality pool of part proposals. This allows for a much simpler and faster part model creation without the need to explicitly consider appearance of the individual parts as done in previous works~ _cite_ . At the same time, we do not need any ground-truth part locations or bounding boxes. The obtained approach and learning algorithm improves the state-of-the-art in fine-grained recognition on three datasets including CUBN-N~ _cite_ if no ground-truth part or bounding box annotations are available at all. In addition, we show how to use the same approach for generic object recognition on Caltech-N. This is a major difference to previous work on fine-grained recognition, since most approaches are not directly applicable to other tasks. For example, our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Caltech-N without the need for expensive dense evaluation on different scales of the image~ _cite_ . Furthermore, our work has impact beyond fine-grained recognition, since our method can also be used to guide data augmentation during fine-tuning for image classification. We demonstrate in our experiments that it even yields a more discriminative CNN compared to a CNN fine-tuned with ground-truth bounding boxes of the object. In the next section, we give a brief overview over recent approaches in the areas of part constellation models and fine-grained classification. Sect.~ _ref_ reviews the approach of Simon~ \etal~ _cite_ for part proposal generation. In Sect.~ _ref_, we present our flexible unsupervised part discovery method. The remaining paper is dedicated to the experiments on several datasets (Sect.~ _ref_) and conclusions (Sect.~ _ref_) .
