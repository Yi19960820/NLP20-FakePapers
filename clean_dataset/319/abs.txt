Data availability plays a critical role for the performance of deep learning systems. This challenge is especially acute within the medical image domain, particularly when pathologies are involved, due to two factors: N) limited number of cases, and N) large variations in location, scale, and appearance. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting a dataset with artificially generated lung nodules can improve the robustness of the progressive holistically nested network (P-HNN) model for pathological lung segmentation of CT scans. To achieve this goal, we develop a ND generative adversarial network (GAN) that effectively learns lung nodule property distributions in ND space. In order to embed the nodules within their background context, we condition the GAN based on a volume of interest whose central part containing the nodule has been erased. To further improve realism and blending with the background, we propose a novel multi-mask reconstruction loss. We train our method on over _inline_eq_ nodules from the LIDC dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-art. We then use our GAN to generate simulated training images where nodules lie on the lung border, which are cases where the published P-HNN model struggles. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that armed with these simulated images, the P-HNN model learns to better segment lung regions under these challenging situations. As a result, our system provides a promising means to help overcome the data paucity that commonly afflicts medical imaging.
