\makebox [s] {The articulated and complex nature of human actions makes} \par \makebox [s] {the task of action recognition difficult. One approach to handle this} \par \makebox [s] {complexity is dividing it to the kinetics of body parts and analyzing} \par \makebox [s] {the actions based on these partial descriptors. We propose a joint} \par \makebox [s] {sparse regression based learning method which utilizes the structured} \par \makebox [s] {sparsity to model each action as a combination of multimodal features} \par \makebox [s] {from a sparse set of body parts. To represent dynamics and appearance} \par \makebox [s] {of parts, we employ a heterogeneous set of depth and skeleton based} \par \makebox [s] {features. The proper structure of multimodal multipart features are} \par \makebox [s] {formulated into the learning framework via the proposed hierarchical} \par \makebox [s] {mixed norm, to regularize the structured features of each part and to} \par \makebox [s] {apply sparsity between them, in favor of a group feature selection.} \par \makebox [s] {Our experimental results expose the effectiveness of the proposed} \par \makebox [s] {learning method in which it outperforms other methods in all three tested} \par datasets while saturating one of them by achieving perfect accuracy.
