We present DLTK, a toolkit providing baseline implementations for efficient experimentation with deep learning methods on biomedical images. It builds on top of TensorFlow and its high modularity and easy-to-use examples allow for a low-threshold access to state-of-the-art implementations for typical medical imaging problems. A comparison of DLTK's reference implementations of popular network architectures for image segmentation demonstrates new top performance on the publicly available challenge data ``Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault''. The average test Dice similarity coefficient of _inline_eq_ exceeds the previously best performing CNN (_inline_eq_) and the accuracy of the challenge winning method (_inline_eq_) .
