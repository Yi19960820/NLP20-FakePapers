Breast cancer is the most lethal cancer among women worldwide~ _cite_ . Treatment efficiency can increase up to N \% if detected in earlier stages ~ _cite_ . To detect those tumors the most adopted exam is the Full-field Digital Mammography (FFDM), where the radiologist looks for anomalies such as masses, microcalcifications and architectural distortion~ _cite_ . Architectural Distortion (AD) is the earliest manifestation of breast cancer and can appear up to two years before the formation of any other anomaly. It is a very subtle anomaly that changes the texture of breast parenchyma and it is very hard to be detected through the human visual system~ _cite_ . It has been reported that AD is the most common finding in retrospective cases of false-negative in FFDM ~ _cite_ . Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new area of Machine Learning (ML) that have attracted the attention of the scientific community. Its great advantage of methods simplify the whole classical process of description and pattern classification, by replacing it with a general learning procedure that provides information at various levels of abstraction~ _cite_ . As a result, some Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are currently using deep architectures to improve diagnostic accuracy, which has yielded superior results if compared to those using classical ML systems~ _cite_ . One of the most popular deep architectures is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ~ _cite_ . Its arrangement is basically structured of overlapping convolution and pooling layers that are responsible for the pattern learn which occurs at various levels of abstraction. The training process of this network has become increasingly practical thanks to its parallelizable algorithm allied to technological advances in graphical processing units, making it the most popular deep architecture currently used for developments with CAD~ _cite_ . One implication of using deep architectures is the high amount of data it requires to perform a proper model training. To overcome this limitation, a technique called has been widely used to increase the dataset samples, by applying transformations on the input samples to increase the amount of data~ _cite_ . This paper focus on the use of DL to help the detection of AD in FFDM images. Because clinical FFDM datasets are most private and, when available, with limited amount of cases with AD, this paper proposes the use of data augmentation to improve the training step of the CNN even with a limited number of images in the dataset.
