Histopathological images (HI) encrypt resolution dependent heterogeneous textures \& diverse color distribution variability, manifesting in micro-structural surface tissue convolutions \& inherently high coherency of cancerous cells posing significant challenges to breast cancer (BC) multi-classification. As such, multi-class stratification is sparsely explored \& prior work mainly focus on benign \& malignant tissue characterization only, which forestalls further quantitative analysis of subordinate classes like adenosis, mucinous carcinoma \& fibroadenoma etc, for diagnostic competence. In this work, a fully-automated, near-real-time \& computationally inexpensive robust multi-classification deep framework from HI is presented. The proposed scheme employs deep neural network (DNN) aided discriminative ensemble of holistic class-specific manifold learning (CSML) for underlying HI sub-space embedding \& HI hashing based local shallow signatures. The model achieves N \% accuracy pertinent to multi-classification, an N \% overall performance improvement \& N enhancement for Lobular carcinoma (LC) sub-class recognition rate as compared to the existing state-of-the-art on well known BreakHis dataset is achieved. Also, N \% recognition rate at N _inline_eq_ \& a sensitivity of N \% for binary grading at all magnification validates its suitability for clinical deployment in hand-held smart devices.
