Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important problem in computer vision with many applications, such as surveillance, behavior analysis, and sport video analysis. Although the performance of MOT has been significantly improved in recent years _cite_, it is still a challenging problem due to factors such as missed detections, false detections, and identification switches. An automatic MOT system usually employs a pre-trained object detector to locate candidate object regions in each frame, then match the detections across frames to form target trajectories. Most existing methods only consider the pairwise dependencies of detections (\eg, _cite_), and do not take full advantage of the high-order dependencies among multiple targets across frames. This strategy is less effective when nearby objects with similar appearance or motion patterns occlude each other in the video. Several recent methods _cite_ attempt to use the high-order information to improve the tracking performance, such as dense structure search on hypergraph _cite_, tensor power iterations _cite_, high-order motion constraints _cite_, and multiple hypothesis tracking _cite_ . However, the aforementioned methods merely exploit fixed degrees of dependencies among objects, which limits the flexibility of the hypergraph model in complex environments, and calls for adaptive dependency patterns. As shown in Figure _ref_, _inline_eq_-uniform hypergraph is unable to describe the dependencies between two tracklets of target _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ correctly. On the contrary, non-uniform hypergraph better adapts to different degrees of dependencies among tracklets, and achieves more reliable performance. In this paper, we describe a new {\em non-uniform} hypergraph learning based tracker (NT), which has much stronger descriptive power to accommodate different tracking scenarios than the conventional graph _cite_ or uniform hypergraph _cite_ . The nodes in the hypergraph correspond to the tracklets, and the hyperedges with different degrees encode similarities among tracklets to assemble various kinds of appearance and motion patterns. The tracking problem is formulated as searching dense structures on the non-uniform hypergraph. Different from previous methods _cite_, we do not fix the degree of the hypergraph model, but mix hyperedges of different degrees and learn their relative weights automatically from the data using the structural support vector machine (SSVM) method _cite_ . We propose an efficient approximation algorithm to exploit the dense structures to form long object trajectories to complete the tracking task. In addition, to achieve both accuracy and efficiency, we use a near-online strategy for MOT, \ie, we perform the dense structure searching on the non-uniform hypergraph to generate short tracklets in a temporal window, and then associate those short tracklets to the tracked targets to get the final trajectories of targets at the current time stamp. This process is carried out repeatedly to complete the tracking task in a video. The main contributions are summarized as follows. (N) We propose a non-uniform hypergraph learning based near-online MOT method, which assembles the hyperedges with different degrees to encode various types of dependencies among objects. (N) The weights of hyperedges with different degrees in the non-uniform hypergraph are learned from data using the SSVM algorithm. (N) We propose an efficient approximation algorithm to complete the dense structure searching problem on the non-uniform hypergraph.
