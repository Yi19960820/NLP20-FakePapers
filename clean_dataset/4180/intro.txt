Optical coherence tomography is an established imaging modality in ophthalmology that provides micrometer resolution ND images of sub-surface biological tissue. It can be used to monitor disease progression, such as in diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . High quality visualizations of the retinal structures provided by OCT images can improve the understanding of the onset and development of these retinal diseases, which are increasing in prevalence and are major causes of visual morbidity _cite_ . As such, tools to evaluate the health of the retina non-invasively and quantitatively are urgently needed. Previously, our group used machine learning to segment the retinal vasculature in OCT angiograms _cite_ with promising results. Accurate segmentations of regions of cystic macular edema (denoted as "fluid") are also of interest to ophthalmic clinicians. Although ND OCT images can visualize these regions of fluid, quantitative measurements of size in response to treatment require automated computational algorithms. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) have demonstrated excellent performance for image segmentation tasks _cite_ . An advanced version, the U-net _cite_, has proven to out-perform other methods in the application of segmenting small data sets of medical images, such as neural structures _cite_, the kidney _cite_ and liver tumors _cite_ . In this paper, we present a novel FCN-based framework for the segmentation and detection of retinal fluid in OCT images. The network used for segmentation followed the U-net structure detailed in Section _ref_, but took additional spatial information as input. Segmentation results were further improved by random forest classifiers trained on the candidate fluid regions.
