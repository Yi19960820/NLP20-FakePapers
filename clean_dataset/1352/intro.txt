Malignant melanoma, which is commonly known as melanoma, is the most dangerous type of skin cancer _cite_ . It is developed in melanocytes, which are cells producing melanin and and they are giving skin its colour. The risk of melanoma has increasing trend, especially for women under N. The positive fact is that this form of cancer can be treated successfully with high rate, when it is detected and recognized early. However, the examination of suspicious skin lesions is time-consuming and it requires the knowledge of an expert. It is therefore natural that much research is put to automation of the melanoma recognition process. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis, sponsored by the International Society for Digital Imaging of the Skin (ISDIS) . The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions. In N, ISIC organized already third grand challenge focused on early melanoma detection. This challenge was divided into three separate tasks, where the third tasks was disease classification. We are presenting here our framework for automated predictions of disease classification within dermoscopic images. Data for this task was extracted from the "ISIC N: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" (ISIC N) grand challenge datasets _cite_ . The disease categories recognized in this challenge include: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic nevus (NV), Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), Actinic keratosis / Bowen's disease (AKIEC), Benign keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), and Vascular lesion (VASC) .
