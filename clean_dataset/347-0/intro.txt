The process of freehand sketching has long been employed by humans to communicate ideas and intent in a minimalist yet almost universally understandable manner. In spite of the challenges posed in recognizing them~ _cite_, sketches have formed the basis of applications in areas of forensic analysis~ _cite_, electronic classroom systems~ _cite_, sketch-based retrieval~ _cite_ etc. Sketching is an inherently sequential process. The proliferation of pen and tablet based devices today enables us to capture and analyze the entire process of sketching, thus providing additional information compared to passive parsing of static sketched content. Yet, most sketch recognition approaches either ignore the sequential aspect or lack the ability to exploit it~ _cite_ . The few approaches which attempt to exploit the sequential sketch stroke data do so either in an unnatural manner~ _cite_ or impose restrictive constraints (e.g. Markov assumption) ~ _cite_ . In our work, we propose a recurrent neural network architecture for sketch object recognition which exploits the long-term sequential and structural regularities in stroke data in a scalable manner. We make the following contributions: Given the on-line nature of our recognition framework, it is especially suited for on-the-fly interpretation of sketches as they are drawn. Thus, our framework can enable interesting applications such as camera-equipped robots playing the popular party game Pictionary~ _cite_ with human players, generating sparsified yet recognizable sketches of objects~ _cite_, interpreting hand-drawn digital content in electronic classrooms~ _cite_ etc.
