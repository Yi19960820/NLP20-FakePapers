As Deep Neural Networks are becoming more popular, much of the attention is being devoted to Computer Vision problems that used to be solved with more traditional approaches. Video frame interpolation is one of such challenges that has seen new research involving various techniques in deep learning. In this paper, we replicate the work of on Adaptive Separable Convolution, which claims high quality results on the video frame interpolation task. We apply the same network structure trained on a smaller dataset and experiment with various different loss functions, in order to determine the optimal approach in data-scarce scenarios. The best resulting model is still able to provide visually pleasing videos, although achieving lower evaluation scores.
