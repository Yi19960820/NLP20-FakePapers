\vspace* {-N} Recent terrorist attacks in major cities around the world have brought many casualties among innocent citizens . In this context, we need systems able to provide real-time alerts about potential threats, so that people can enjoy life in their own cities without being afraid of terrorist attacks. In this paper, we deal with the problem of abandoned luggage detection. When an object, usually a suitcase or a bag, is left unattended in a public area, e.g. airport terminal or train station, it represents a security threat because the abandoned object may contain dangerous items such as explosives or biological warfare. For this reason, the abandoned object must be removed immediately from the public area by authorized personnel. To this end, we propose a system that is able to automatically detect abandoned luggage items in real-time by analyzing the video from surveillance cameras. Our approach is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, we detect static objects based on background subtraction and motion estimation, as most related works~ _cite_ . In the second stage, we apply a cascade of (CNN) based on the GoogLeNet~ _cite_ architecture to distinguish between abandoned luggage items and other objects, e.g. persons standing still. To obtain robust CNN models, we provide two types of examples: images collected from the Internet and realistic examples generated by imposing various suitcases and bags over the scene's background. To our best knowledge, we are the first to train a cascade of convolutional neural networks for abandoned luggage recognition. The paper is organized as follows. Related work on abandoned luggage detection is presented in Section~ _ref_ . Our learning framework is described in Section~ _ref_ . The abandoned luggage detection experiments are presented in Section~ _ref_ . Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section~ _ref_ .
