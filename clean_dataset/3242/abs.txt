This paper proposes the problem of point-and-count as a test case to break the what-and-where deadlock. Different from the traditional detection problem, the goal is to discover key salient points as a way to localize and count the number of objects simultaneously. We propose two alternatives, one that counts first and then point, and another that works the other way around. Fundamentally, they pivot around whether we solve ``what'' or ``where'' first. We evaluate their performance on dataset that contains multiple instances of the same class, demonstrating the potentials and their synergies. The experiences derive a few important insights that explains why this is a much harder problem than classification, including strong data bias and the inability to deal with object scales robustly in state-of-art convolutional neural networks.
