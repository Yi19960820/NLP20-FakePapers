Roughly one eighth of women in the United States will develop breast cancer during their lifetimes~ _cite_ . Early intervention is critical---five-year relative survival rates can be up to N-N times higher for cancers detected at an early stage versus at a later stage~ _cite_ . An important tool for early detection is screening mammography, which has been attributed with a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality~ _cite_ . However, the overall value of screening mammography is limited by several factors: reading mammograms is a tedious and error-prone process, and not all radiologists achieve uniformly high levels of accuracy~ _cite_ . In particular, empirically high false positive rates in screening mammography can lead to significant unnecessary cost and patient stress _cite_ . For these reasons, effective machine vision-based solutions for reading mammograms hold significant potential to improve patient outcomes. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for mammography have typically relied on hand-engineered features~ _cite_ . With the recent success of deep learning in other fields, there have been several promising attempts to apply these techniques to mammography~ _cite_ . Many of these approaches have been designed for specific tasks or subtasks of a full evaluation pipeline, for instance, mass segmentation~ _cite_ or region-of-interest (ROI) microcalcification classification~ _cite_ . Here, we address the full problem of binary cancer status classification: given an entire mammogram image, we seek to classify whether cancer is present~ _cite_ . As recent efforts have shown~ _cite_, creating an effective end-to-end differentiable model, the cornerstone of supervised deep learning, is challenging given the ``needle in a haystack'' nature of the problem. To address this challenge, we have developed a two-stage, curriculum learning-based~ _cite_ approach. We first train patch-level CNN classifiers at multiple scales, which are then used as feature extractors in a sliding-window fashion to build an image-level model. Initialized with the patch-trained weights, the image-level model can then effectively be trained end-to-end. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the largest public mammography database, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) ~ _cite_ . Evaluated against the final pathology outcomes, we achieve an AUROC of N
