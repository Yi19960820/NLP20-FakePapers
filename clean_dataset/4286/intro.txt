Regular physical exercising improves an athlete's health and well-being; sufferings from chronic diseases or even the Alzheimer's disease are lowered _cite_ . In that context, mobile phone applications for training support (e.g., running, CrossFit, etc.) became popular. They provide customized workout plans, detailed exercise instructions as well as quantitative and statistical functions. But by providing know-how about challenging exercises without supervision to non-experienced athletes arises new problems. Wrong execution of exercises, malpositions, or the absence of sufficient warming up phases may lead to less training success or even to serious injuries. Especially non-experienced athletes are likely to harm themselves during an unsupevised workout _cite_ . \par We believe that a pro-active and automated monitoring reduces such injuries drastically while a training's success could be improved significantly. Moreover, a generic concept capable of recognizing and assessing various recurrent human motions is also applicable in other areas, e.g., medical observations, gait analysis or optimization of workflows. To address this unsolved issue we previously introduced SensX, which is a distributed sensor system for capturing and processing human motion _cite_ . We established a paradigm for qualitative analysis of human motion consisting of four fundamental steps (see Figure _ref_): (N) Detection of a motion event, (N) its Recognition, (N) its qualitative Assessment, and (N) the Characterization of reasons for a specific assessment. Step (N) and (N) were treated within _cite_, while this paper focuses on step (N) by using the existing SensX architecture as a basis. \par Thereby, our contributions within this paper are as follows:
