\vspace* {-N} Clinical applications set very high bars for machine learning algorithms, because any misdiagnosis could impact treatment plans and gravely harm the patient. To reach the required performance, supervised learning is the leading technique, and its success is well established. However, a challenge in supervised learning is that it requires a large amount of labeled data, especially when deep neural networks are used. Unfortunately, expert labeling of medical images requires enormous time and cost. The problem is exacerbated when accurate pixelwise labeling is required. Accordingly, medical segmentation datasets tend to be relatively small~ _cite_ . Active learning (AL) aims to address the paucity of labeled data by reasoned choice of which available unlabeled examples to annotate~ _cite_ . A limitation of many prior studies of AL is that they validated AL only in a core-set selection setting, ~ _cite_ rather than demonstrating its utility in growing the labeled data, and also did not attempt to model the cost of labeling~ _cite_ . However, the potential value/use of AL is not in achieving comparable performance with less data, but in improving the model while also minimizing labeling costs. On other problems it has been shown that labeling costs vary greatly from one example to another~ _cite_ . In the case of intracranial hemorrhage, we observe that times needed for pixelwise labeling vary up to N orders of magnitude for different cases (See Fig.~ _ref_) . Most AL studies to date select examples without addressing this wide variation in labeling time~ _cite_ . In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive AL system by combining the query-by-committee~ _cite_ approach with labeling time prediction for each example. Our uniform-cost AL system compares favorably with the state of the art~ _cite_, while the cost-sensitive system gives a further boost under labeling time constraints. All experiments are conducted on our pixelwise-labeled dataset (_inline_eq_ frames), which is about two orders of magnitude larger than standard MICCAI segmentation datasets~ _cite_ . Moreover, our system is simpler, faster, and uses less memory than earlier works~ _cite_ . Through the example of intracranial hemorrhage detection, we demonstrate the potential of cost-sensitive active learning to scale up medical datasets efficiently. \vspace* {-N}
