Fetal brain imaging is a cornerstone of prenatal screening and early diagnosis of congenital anomalies. Knowledge of fetal gestational age is the key to the accurate assessment of brain development. This study develops an attention-based deep learning model to predict gestational age of the fetal brain. The proposed model is an end-to-end framework that combines key insights from multi-view MRI including axial, coronal, and sagittal views. The model also uses age-activated weakly-supervised attention maps to enable rotation-invariant localization of the fetal brain among background noise. We evaluate our methods on the collected fetal brain MRI cohort with a large age distribution from N to N days. Our extensive experiments show age prediction performance with _inline_eq_ using multi-view MRI and attention.
