For many computer vision problems, the deep neural networks are trained and validated based on the assumption that the input images are pristine (i.e., artifact-free) . However, digital images are subject to a wide range of distortions in real application scenarios, while the practical issues regarding image quality in high level visual information understanding have been largely ignored. In this paper, in view of the fact that most widely deployed deep learning models are susceptible to various image distortions, the distorted images are involved for data augmentation in the deep neural network training process to learn a reliable model for practical applications. In particular, an image quality assessment based label smoothing method, which aims at regularizing the label distribution of training images, is further proposed to tune the objective functions in learning the neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in dealing with both low and high quality images in the typical image classification task.
