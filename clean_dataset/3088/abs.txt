The artistic style of a painting is a subtle aesthetic judgment used by art historians for grouping and classifying artwork. The recently introduced `neural-style' algorithm substantially succeeds in merging the perceived artistic style of one image or set of images with the perceived content of another. In light of this and other recent developments in image analysis via convolutional neural networks, we investigate the effectiveness of a `neural-style' representation for classifying the artistic style of paintings.
