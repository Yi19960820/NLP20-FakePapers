Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in the pathological and functional studies of the brain, such as epilepsy, tumor diagnosis, etc. Automated accurate brain tissue segmentation like cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) is the basis of these studies and many researchers are seeking it to the best. Based on the truth that multi-channel segmentation network with its own ground truth achieves up to average dice ratio N, we propose a novel method that we add a fourth channel with the ground truth of the most similar imageâ€™s obtained by CBIR from the database. The results show that the method improves the segmentation performance, as measured by average dice ratio, by approximately N in the MRBrainSN database. In addition, our method is concise and robust, which can be used to any network architecture that needs not be modified a lot.
