In the isointense stage, the accurate volumetric image segmentation is a challenging task due to the low contrast between tissues. In this paper, we propose a novel very deep network architecture based on densely convolutional network for volumetric brain segmentation. The proposed network architecture provides a dense connection between layers that aims to improve the information flow in the network. By concatenating features map of fine and coarse dense blocks, it allows capturing multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed method over existing methods, in terms of both segmentation accuracy and parameter efficiency in MICCAI grand challenge on N-month infant brain MRI segmentation.
