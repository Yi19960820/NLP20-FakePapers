Since its appearance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ~ _cite_ have received a lot of interest in the AI community. In image generation several projects showed how GANs are able to generate photorealistic images but the results so far didn't look adequate for the quality standard of visual media production industry. We present an optimized image generation process based on a Deep Convolutional Genera \-tive Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), in order to create photorealistic high-resolution images (up to NxN pixels) . Furthermore, the system was fed with a limited dataset of images, less than two thousand images. All these results give more clue about future exploitation of GANs in Computer Graphics and Visual Effects.
