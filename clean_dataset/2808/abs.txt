We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom relocalization system. Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the N-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking Nms per frame to compute. It obtains approximately Nm and N \degree accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and N and N \degree accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient N layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show that the PoseNet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples.
