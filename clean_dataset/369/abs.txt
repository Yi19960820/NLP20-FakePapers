Generative Adversarial Networks are proved to be efficient on various kinds of image generation tasks. However, it is still a challenge if we want to generate images precisely. Many researchers focus on how to generate images with one attribute. But image generation under multiple attributes is still a tough work. In this paper, we try to generate a variety of face images under multiple constraints using a pipeline process. The Pip-GAN (Pipeline Generative Adversarial Network) we present employs a pipeline network structure which can generate a complex facial image step by step using a neutral face image. We applied our method on two face image databases and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of unseen identities under multiple conditions previously.
