Semantic segmentation requires an understanding of an image at a pixel level and is an important tool for scene understanding. It is a difficult problem as scenes often vary significantly in pose and appearance. However it is an important problem as it can be used to infer scene geometry and object support relationships. This has wide ranging applications from robotic interaction to autonomous driving. Previous approaches to scene understanding used low level visual features _cite_ . We are now seeing the emergence of machine learning techniques for this problem _cite_ . In particular deep learning _cite_ has set the benchmark on many popular datasets _cite_ . However none of these deep learning methods produce a probabilistic segmentation with a measure of model uncertainty. Uncertainty should be a natural part of any predictive system's output. Knowing the confidence with which we can trust the semantic segmentation output is important for decision making. For instance, a system on an autonomous vehicle may segment an object as a pedestrian. But it is desirable to know the model uncertainty with respect to other classes such as street sign or cyclist as this can have a strong effect on behavioural decisions. Uncertainty is also immediately useful for other applications such as active learning _cite_, semi-supervised learning, or label propagation _cite_ . The main contribution of this paper is extending deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural network architectures _cite_ to Bayesian convolutional neural networks which can produce a probabilistic segmentation output _cite_ . In Section _ref_ we propose Bayesian SegNet, a probabilistic deep convolutional neural network framework for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. We use dropout at test time which allows us to approximate the posterior distribution by sampling from the Bernoulli distribution across the network's weights. This is achieved with no additional parameterisation. In Section _ref_, we demonstrate that Bayesian SegNet sets the best performing benchmark on prominent scene understanding datasets, CamVid Road Scenes _cite_ and SUN RGB-D Indoor Scene Understanding _cite_ . In particular, we find a larger performance improvement on smaller datasets such as CamVid where the Bayesian Neural Network is able to cope with the additional uncertainty from a smaller amount of data. Moreover, we show in section _ref_ that this technique is broadly applicable across a number of state of the art architectures and achieves a N-N \% improvement in segmenation accuracy when applied to SegNet _cite_, FCN _cite_ and Dilation Network _cite_ . Finally in Section _ref_ we demonstrate the effectiveness of model uncertainty. We show this measure can be used to understand with what confidence we can trust image segmentations. We also explore what factors contribute to Bayesian SegNet making an uncertain prediction.
