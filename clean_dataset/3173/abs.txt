We present a new approach to ensemble learning. Our approach differs from previous approaches in that it constructs and applies different predictive models to different subsets of the feature space. It does this by constructing a tree of subsets of the feature space and associating a predictor (predictive model) to each node of the tree; we call the resulting object a {\em tree of predictors} . The (locally) optimal tree of predictors is derived recursively; each step involves {\em jointly optimizing} the split of the terminal nodes of the previous tree and the choice of learner (from among a given set of base learners) and training set--hence predictor--for each set in the split. The features of a new instance determine a unique path through the optimal tree of predictors; the final prediction aggregates the predictions of the predictors along this path. Thus, our approach uses base learners to create complex learners that are matched to the characteristics of the data set while avoiding overfitting. We establish loss bounds for the final predictor in terms of the Rademacher complexity of the base learners. We report the results of a number of experiments on a variety of datasets, showing that our approach provides statistically significant improvements over a wide variety of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including various ensemble learning methods.
