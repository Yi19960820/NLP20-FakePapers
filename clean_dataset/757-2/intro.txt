Deep Learning has brought a new era in machine learning. Being able to learn more complex features from images, problems such as classification, localization, segmentation has seen remarkable progress especially for natural images. Previously most significant research in the domain of natural image processing was performed using some sort of pattern recognition over pixels ~ _cite_ . The problem that has been dealt in this paper is semantic image segmentation. Image segmentation goes beyond tasks like object recognition or localization. In this problem we are mainly interested in precise segments which semantically separates one object from another. While pixel level algorithms ~ _cite_ provide very fine level segmentation, superpixels ~ _cite_ provide much lesser computational complexity while not compromising performance. Superpixels refer to small patches of adjacent similar pixels grouped together. We have used these superpixels for our algorithms thus providing real-time performance. C onvolutional n eural n etworks (CNNs) have showed tremendous performance in the field of natural image processing as well as segmentation. In our approach we have implemented multiple convolutional neural networks to obtain results. Any classification problem can be associated with uncertainty in the decision process. We have used some ensemble methods as well as Dempster-Shafer Theory to handle such uncertainty. The next section will give a brief review of some related works. Section N will explain the methodologies. In section N and N will cover the experimentations and discussions regarding obtained results.
