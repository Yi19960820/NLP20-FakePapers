Scene completion has drawn a lot of attention recently from the computer vision~ _cite_, robotics~ _cite_ as well as the neuroscience community~ _cite_ . Most of these works are driven by the assumption that ND scene completion is important for ND scene understanding which in turn is useful for tasks such as robot navigation. Towards this end, recent works have addressed ND scene completion by semantic voxel filling~ _cite_ . However, these approaches are limited as follows: (i) semantic labeling of ND voxels will generally produce coarse labelings in order to be computationally feasible, and (ii) labeling of voxels in the object interior might be redundant as one is mostly interested in object surfaces. Therefore, we focus on predicting detailed surfaces rather than semantic voxels. Moreover, methods predicting entire voxel grids rely on large labeled datasets that are expensive to create and label~ _cite_ . In contrast, our system does not require any additional labeled data and only relies on calibrated depth images which are easy to acquire using existing RGB-D sensors~ _cite_ . An instance of the predicted output is displayed in Fig.~ _ref_ . In summary our contributions are as follows:
