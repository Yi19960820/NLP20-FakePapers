State-of-the-art imaging devices such as electron microscopy (EM) allow life science researchers to study biological structures at high resolution. Due to advanced EM imaging, researchers have found e.g. a correlation between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula (ER) on the one hand and diseases such as cancer and Parkinson on the other hand _cite_ . Consequently, high throughput image analysis of these structures has gained a lot of attention the last years. Because of the big data volumes and complex image content, this analysis requires computationally efficient and high-quality segmentation algorithms. However, state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms typically require more computational effort in order to capture more feature variability or modeling. Advanced and expensive ND EM devices are therefore not fully exploited as long as real-time and high-quality segmentation (jointly) is not possible. Generally speaking, mitochondria and ER are delineated by membranes with the same visual characteristics (Fig. _ref_) . We propose a membrane extraction method based on convolutional neural networks that can help segmenting complete mitochondria and ER in Sec. _ref_ . In order to improve the practical usablity, we prune and retrain the original network such that the most relevant features remain present and redundancy is reduced (Sec. _ref_) . The obtained networks are more efficient in terms of runtime and memory requirements, without significantly affecting the original accuracy (Sec. _ref_) .
