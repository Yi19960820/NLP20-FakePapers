State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet _cite_ and Fast R-CNN _cite_ have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with ``attention'' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-N model _cite_, our detection system has a frame rate of Nfps () on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC N, N, and MS COCO datasets with only N proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO N competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the Nst-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.
