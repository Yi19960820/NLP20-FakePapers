There has been a steady increase in the incidence of skin cancer worldwide, with a high rate of mortality. Early detection and segmentation of skin lesions is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, necessary to improve the survival rate of patients. However, skin lesion segmentation is a challenging task due to the low contrast of lesions and their high similarity in terms of appearance, to healthy tissue. This underlines the need for an accurate and automatic approach for skin lesion segmentation. To tackle this issue, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) called SkinNet. The proposed CNN is a modified version of U-Net. We compared the performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art techniques, using the ISBI N challenge dataset. Our approach outperformed the others in terms of the Dice coefficient, Jaccard index and sensitivity, evaluated on the held-out challenge test data set, across N-fold cross validation experiments. SkinNet achieved an average value of N, N and N \%, for the DC, JI and SE, respectively.
