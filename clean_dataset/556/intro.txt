Object detection methods have moved from scanning window approaches~ _cite_ to ones based on bottom-up object proposals~ _cite_ . Bottom-up proposals~ _cite_ have two major advantages: N) by reducing the search space, they allow the usage of more sophisticated recognition machinery, and N) by pruning away false positives, they make detection easier. ~ _cite_ Most object proposal methods rely on simple bottom-up grouping and saliency cues. The rationale for this is that this step should be reasonably fast and generally applicable to all object categories. However, we believe that there is more to objectness than bottom-up grouping or saliency. For instance, many disparate object categories might share high-level structures (such as the limbs of animals and robots) and detecting such structures might hint towards the presence of objects. A proposal method that incorporates these and other such cues is likely to perform much better. In this paper, we argue for a, notion of objectness. Our approach is to present a large database of images with annotated objects to a learning algorithm, and let the algorithm figure out what low-, mid-and high-level cues are most discriminative of objects. Following recent work on a range of recognition tasks~ _cite_, we use convolutional networks (CNNs) ~ _cite_ for this task. Concretely, we train a CNN to rerank a large pool of object proposals produced by a bottom-up proposal method (we use Edge boxes~ _cite_ for most experiments in this paper) . For ease of reference, we call our approach DeepBox. Figure~ _ref_ shows our framework. We propose a lightweight four layer network architecture that significantly improves over bottom-up proposal methods in terms of ranking (N \% relative improvement on AUC over Edge boxes on VOC N~ _cite_) . Our network architecture is as effective as state-of-the-art classification networks on this task while being much smaller and thus much faster. In addition, using ideas from SPP~ _cite_ and Fast R-CNN~ _cite_, our implementation runs in N ms per image, comparable to some of the fastest bottom-up proposal approaches like Edge Boxes (N ms) . We also provide evidence that what our network learns is category-agnostic: our improvements in performance generalize to categories that the CNN has not seen before (N \% improvement over Edge boxes on COCO~ _cite_) . Our results suggest that a) there is indeed a generic, semantic notion of objectness beyond bottom-up saliency, and that b) this semantic notion of objectness can be learnt effectively by a lightweight CNN. Object proposals are just the first step in an object detection system, and the final evaluation of a proposal system is the impact it has on detection performance. We show that the Fast R-CNN detection system~ _cite_, using N DeepBox proposals per image, is N points better than the same object detector using N Edge box proposals. Thus our high quality proposals directly lead to better object detection. The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. In Section~ _ref_ we discuss related work. We describe our network architecture and training and testing procedures in Section~ _ref_ . Section~ _ref_ describes experiments and we end with a discussion.
