We consider a problem of diagnostic pattern recognition/classification from neuroimaging data. We propose a common data analysis pipeline for neuroimaging-based diagnostic classification problems using various ML algorithms and processing toolboxes for brain imaging. We illustrate the pipeline application by discovering new biomarkers for diagnostics of epilepsy and depression based on clinical and MRI/fMRI data for patients and healthy volunteers.
