In this work, we research and evaluate end-to-end learning of monocular semantic-metric occupancy grid mapping from weak binocular ground truth. The network learns to predict four classes, as well as a camera to bird's eye view mapping. At the core, it utilizes a variational encoder-decoder network that encodes the front-view visual information of the driving scene and subsequently decodes it into a N-D top-view Cartesian coordinate system. The evaluations on Cityscapes show that the end-to-end learning of semantic-metric occupancy grids outperforms the deterministic mapping approach with flat-plane assumption by more than N \% mean IoU. Furthermore, we show that the variational sampling with a relatively small embedding vector brings robustness against vehicle dynamic perturbations, and generalizability for unseen KITTI data. Our network achieves real-time inference rates of approx. N Hz for an input image with a resolution of N _inline_eq_ N pixels and an output map with N _inline_eq_ N occupancy grid cells using a Titan V GPU.
