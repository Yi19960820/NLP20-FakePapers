Action recognition and temporal action localization are both important branches of video content analysis. The temporal action localization or detection task aims to detect action instances in untrimmed video, containing categories and temporal boundaries of action instances. Temporal action localization task can be divided into two main parts. (N) Temporal action proposal, which means we need generate some temporal boundaries of action instances without classifying their categories. (N) Action recognition (or we can say action classification), in this part we need to decide the categories of temporal action proposals. Most of previous works _cite_ address these two parts separately. There are also works _cite_ focusing on temporal action proposal. For action recognition, there are already many algorithms _cite_ with great performance. However, the localization accuracy (mean average precision) is still very low in multiple benchmarks such as THUMOS'N _cite_ and ActivityNet _cite_, comparing with the situation in object localization. We think the main constraint on accuracy of temporal action localization is the quality of action proposals. Therefore, we mainly focus on the temporal action proposal task in this challenge and our high quality proposals also lead to state-of-the-art performance in temporal action localization task.
