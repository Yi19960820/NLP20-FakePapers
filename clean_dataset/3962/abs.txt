This work summarizes our submission for the Task N: Disease Classification of ISIC N challenge in Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. We use a novel deep neural network (DNN) ensemble architecture introduced by us that can effectively classify skin lesions by using data-augmentation and bagging to address paucity of data and prevent over-fitting. The ensemble is composed of two DNN architectures: Inception-vN and Inception-Resnet-vN. The DNN architectures are combined in to an ensemble by using a _inline_eq_ convolution for fusion in a meta-learning layer.
