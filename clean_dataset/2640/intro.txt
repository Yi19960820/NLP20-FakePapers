Shape models have been widely used in medical imaging, not only as a prior for segmentation algorithms, but also as a powerful tool to assess morphological differences between subjects _cite_ . A critical element in shape analysis is the choice of a numerical representation which can be used for a quantitative analysis of shape. Multiple shape representations have been previously explored, ranging from very basic volumetric and thickness measurements _cite_, to more complex models such as Point Distribution Models _cite_, spectral signatures _cite_, spherical harmonics _cite_, medial representations _cite_, and diffeomorphisms _cite_ . Despite the ample success of deep learning for many medical imaging tasks, their application for medical shape analysis is still largely unexplored; mainly because typical shape representations such as point clouds and meshes do not possess an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure. Deep networks can learn complex, hierarchical feature representations from data that typically outperforms hand-crafted features, which are not optimal for the given task. Recently, we have introduced the Multi-Structure PointNet (MSPNet) _cite_, which is able to learn shape representations directly on point clouds and can predict a label given the shape of multiple brain structures. To the best of our knowledge MSPNet is the first deep end-to-end learning system used to perform prediction based on organ shapes. MSPNet operates directly on point clouds, without the need to create meshes and it does not require computing point correspondences between different shapes. As most work on shape analysis, we have used MSPNet in the study brain morphology; however, the use of shape models to analyze other anatomical regions remains a relatively unexplored area. In an effort to fill this gap, we propose the deep shape analysis of abdominal anatomy. Our main interest lies on the use of MSPNet to learn shape representations which are able to measure morphological differences in the liver and spleen of healthy subjects when compared to individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide prevalent condition, which is defined by levels of hyperglycaemia giving rise to risk of microvascular damage and its diagnosis is associated with complications, which lead to reduced life expectancy and diminished quality of life _cite_ . Concretely, we propose the first deep learning approach operating on the shape of abdominal organs for the prediction of diabetes. Further, we extend the state-of-the-art shape representation BrainPrint _cite_ to the abdomen, yielding the AbdomenPrint. Finally, we compare MSPNet and AbdomenPrint in the challenging task of predicting diabetes directly from the shape of the liver and spleen. \def \def The use of shape models for the analysis of morphological changes associated with disease or other factors has mainly been explored in neuroimaging. Significant relationships between measurements of brain morphology and a variety of factors such as age _cite_ and neurodegenerative diseases _cite_ have been throughly explored. In this work, we focus on the abdominal organs liver and spleen. Previous approaches have explored the morphological analysis of the liver based on imaging data. Lamecker \etal _cite_ present for the first time a statistical shape model of the liver. Dura \etal _cite_ present the construction of a a probabilistic liver atlas. In terms of using shape models for the diagnosis of liver related diseases, Kohara \etal _cite_ use a statistical shape model of the liver to assess differences between healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with cirrhosis. A similar approach is proposed by Mukherjee \etal _cite_ for the discrimination of chronic liver disease from CT Data and by Hori \etal _cite_ where a statistical shape model is used to evaluate differences in liver shape caused by hepatic fibrosis. Shape analysis of the spleen is a far less explored area of research. Tateyama _cite_ \etal present the use of a Point Distribution Model (PDM) for the analysis of spleen shape. Yates \etal _cite_ present a morphological study of the spleen, relating the principal components obtained from a statistical shape model to anthropometric and demographic information. In this work, we deviate from these previous approaches in the methodology used to assess relationships between abdominal morphology and clinical variables. Instead of modeling shape variation using the commonly used features derived from Point Distribution Models, we evaluate the use of two state-of-the-art approaches: MSPNet _cite_ and BrainPrint _cite_ . These two approaches have previously been used for the morphological analysis of brain structures, but they have yet to be applied for the analysis of abdominal structures.
