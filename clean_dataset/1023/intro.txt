object tracking is a popular topic due to its large range of applications in security, traffic surveillance, autonomous driving, and UAV monitoring. Tracking from aerial platforms can be performed with a number of data modalities including, but not limited to, grayscale _cite_, thermal _cite_, color _cite_ and most recently, hyperspectral imagery _cite_ . Each modality has been exploited for a unique application and comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For the scope of this paper, we will focus on two specific types of sensor modalities: (N) Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), and (N) Adaptive Hyperspectral Imagery. The WAMI platform can scan up to a _inline_eq_ km _inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ km area at N frames per second (fps), with vehicles occupying roughly _inline_eq_-_inline_eq_ pixels. One can perform persistent tracking utilizing this large field of view image. The low spatial resolution of WAMI has good performance in vehicle tracking under certain circumstances but is not super helpful when it comes to handling background clutter, occlusions, and low contrast objects. To counter this, multiple appearance-based features like textures, color histograms, and histogram of gradients, and motion cues are used in combination, leading to multiple heat maps for the search area. This is not feasible in real-time tracking as the methods can become computationally expensive and hence there exists a need to balance between designing complex models and facilitating real-time implementations. The datasets recorded by WAMI are: (N) WPAFB N _cite_ and (N) CLIF _cite_, where each one includes a single video with less than N frames. This is detrimental towards training standalone machine learning and deep learning based architectures since the amount of available data is quite low for training purposes. Since data collection from an aerial platform is lengthy and costly, it is possible to utilize deep learning architectures as feature encoders rather than an end-to-end tracking system. However, WAMI is not a practical platform since it provides single-channel imagery and the deep learning architectures are trained on ImageNet _cite_ which has RGB images. The unique challenges posed by aerial platforms can be better addressed by smarter multi-modal data acquisition. In this direction, the Rochester Institute of Technology Multi-object Spectrometer (RITMOS) concept is utilized by a number of trackers _cite_ as an example that can collect a small, targeted amount of hyperspectral data. The RITMOS captures data in two different modalities: (N) a full frame single channel image, and (N) limited hyperspectral data from the desired pixel locations. It can acquire a full-frame single channel image in about _inline_eq_ sec and scan a row of pixels hyperspectrally in _inline_eq_ ms. Such an adaptive and multi-modal data concept provides more freedom to address aerial tracking challenges. Driven by this freedom and specifications, we design a discriminative tracker to operate on this platform as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . We refer the readers to _cite_ for more information on the workings of RITMOS. The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing (DIRSIG) software has been used before to generate spectral scenarios for varied applications that use conventional computer vision techniques and deep learning based models _cite_ . Since flying spectral sensors on an aerial platform is still an ongoing area of development due to the high costs involved, we evaluate our tracker on synthetic scenarios generated using DIRSIG by _cite_ . In particular, we focus on two scenarios: (N) with trees and (N) without trees. We track N vehicles in both scenarios as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . In addition, we generate a synthetic single-channel aerial dataset for training a CNN and use it to perform vehicle classification on the real WAMI platform, similar to _cite_ (Sect.~ _ref_) . The rich sensory information from hyperspectral imagery has been utilized by generative trackers _cite_ . The discriminative and deep learning driven trackers on the other hand have recently improved the traditional object tracking dramatically. The main challenges behind the application of discriminative and deep learning trackers in aerial hyperspectral images are:
