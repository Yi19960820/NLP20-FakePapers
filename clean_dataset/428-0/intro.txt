Multi-class organ segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT) images is important for medical image analysis. Abdominal organs can have large individual differences due to the shape and size variations, which makes development of automated segmentation methods challenging. With the rapid development of medical image devices and the increase in routinely acquired images, fully automatic multi-organ segmentation of medical images becomes especially important. The segmentation results can be widely utilized in computer-aided diagnosis and computer-assisted surgery. Hence, much research _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ has focused on automated organ segmentation from CT volumes. However, achieving high segmentation accuracy is always challenging. One of the reasons is the low contrast to surrounding tissues which makes segmentations difficult. Failure of segmentation results in a reduction of diagnostic quality. Therefore, improving the segmentation accuracy is an active area of research. Recently, deep learning-based methods achieved impressive segmentation results on medical images. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) make it easier to train models on a large datasets. Especially, ND fully convolutional networks (FCNs) improved the accuracy of multi-organ segmentation from CT volumes. It is well-known that network architecture influences the result of segmentation. Furthermore, the segmentation accuracy relies on the choice of loss function. For this research, we developed a ND FCN which can learn to automatically segment organs on CT volumes from a set of CT and labelled images, and discuss the influence of loss functions and initial learning rates. The paper is organized as the follows. In Section N, we describe the methods we utilized in detail. Section N gives the experiments and results, and we provide a discussion in Section N.
