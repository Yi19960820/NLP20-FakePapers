Recently researchers have been shifting their focus towards learned ND shape descriptors from hand-craft ones to better address challenging issues of the deformation and structural variation inherently present in ND objects. ND geometric data are often transformed to ND Voxel grids with regular format in order to be better fed to a deep neural net architecture. However, the computational intractability of direct application of ND convolutional nets to ND volumetric data severely limits the efficiency (i.e. slow processing) and effectiveness (i.e. unsatisfied accuracy) in processing ND geometric data. In this paper, powered with a novel design of adversarial networks (ND-A-Nets), we have developed a novel ND deep dense shape descriptor (ND-DDSD) to address the challenging issues of efficient and effective ND volumetric data processing. We developed new definition of ND multilayer dense representation (MDR) of ND volumetric data to extract concise but geometrically informative shape description and a novel design of adversarial networks that jointly train a set of convolution neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and an adversarial discriminator. More specifically, the generator network produces ND shape features that encourages the clustering of samples from the same category with correct class label, whereas the discriminator network discourages the clustering by assigning them misleading adversarial class labels. By addressing the challenges posed by the computational inefficiency of direct application of CNN to ND volumetric data, ND-A-Nets can learn high-quality ND-DSDD which demonstrates superior performance on ND shape classification and retrieval over other state-of-the-art techniques by a great margin.
