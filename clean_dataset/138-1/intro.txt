An object detection problem is to predict object of one or more classes given an image. However, the recent advances of deep learning the detection paradigm. In particular, the region-based convolutional detection approach _cite_ us to detect with a single convolutional neural network . In the recent years, in order to detect, deep _cite_ with high classification rate trained on the ImageNet dataset _cite_ are used for extracting object features and combined with several meta-architectures (\ie detectors) such as Faster RCNN _cite_, SSD _cite_, DSSD _cite_ and R-FCN _cite_ . However, it is still challenging to train a single dominant model for all object classes due to the limitations of models and datasets. Also, in general, the detection performance is degraded . To resolve this problem, we therefore propose an different types of detectors for large object detection. In this paper we named the proposed as since it can determine RE {best} detectors (or experts) for each class object detection. our is that detectors with different network structures have different detection rate for object classes . In addition, we presume that a detector with the low mean average precision (mAP) can detect object instances of some classes better than a detector with high mAP., we compare the average precision between the FRCN and DSSD. As shown in Fig. _ref_, for some object classes the DSSD shows the even though the has the higher mAP than ., in this study is to develop the class-wise which can determine the best experts and combine their detections effectively for detecting instances of the . To this end, we first generate . In order to enhance the diversity of the detectors, we trained a set of detectors with feature extractors and meta-architectures. Once the is generated, we generate a ranking matrix which the ranking of the detectors according to their average precision on each class. We then combine responses of top rankers of the pool for detecting the instances of the corresponding class. Although our method is rather simple, there are obvious benefits of the proposed . Most of all, it can be easily implemented and does not require any for ensemble. In addition, in most cases, the performance of the ensemble model is better than that of best single detector Recently, the Nst place winners at ILSVRC _cite_ \& MSCOCO _cite_ N/N competitions improve the performance further using the model ensemble. MSRA _cite_ a union set of region proposals of models and the set is processed by an ensemble of per-region classifiers. For more efficient network ensemble, Google _cite_ models with complementary strength only. To this end, they greedily select models with the highest mAP on a validation set, but prune away a model which shows high similarity for the category AP with the selected ones. However, mAP an indirect metric to select models for ensemble . On the other hand, we use the more . As a result, we can select and combine the best, and it can improve the class-wise performance. To prove the effects of our, we generate a pool consisting of different types of detectors. Each detector was implemented based on recently developed feature extractors (ResNetN/N/N _cite_, VGGNet _cite_ and WRI (wide-residual-inception) Net _cite_) and (_cite_, SSD _cite_ and DSSD _cite_) . By combining them based on our ensemble method, we greatly improve the mAP up to about N \% and N \% on . Remarkably, we won the Nnd place . To summarize, our main contributions are as follows: (N) to combine different detectors effectively and improve the class-wise performance directly, (N), (N) the proposed methods with recent detection and ensemble methods, and the details of our approach for winning the object detection challenge.
