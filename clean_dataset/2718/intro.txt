The goal of face alignment is to localize a set of predefined facial landmarks (eye corners, mouth corners etc.) in an image of a face. Face alignment is an important component of many computer vision applications, such as face verification _cite_, facial emotion recognition _cite_, human-computer interaction _cite_ and facial motion capture _cite_ . Most of the face alignment methods introduced in the recent years are based on shape indexed features _cite_ . In these approaches image features, such as SIFT _cite_ or learned features _cite_, are extracted from image patches extracted around each of the landmarks. The features are then used to iteratively refine the estimates of landmark locations. While those approaches can be successfully applied to face alignment in many photos, their performance on the most challenging datasets~ _cite_ leaves room for improvement~ _cite_ . We believe that this is due to the fact that for the most difficult images the features extracted at disjoint patches do not provide enough information and can lead the method into a local minimum. In this work, we address the above shortcoming by proposing a novel face alignment method which we dub Deep Alignment Network (DAN) . It is based on a multi-stage neural network where each stage refines the landmark positions estimated at the previous stage, iteratively improving the landmark locations. The input to each stage of our algorithm (except the first stage) are a face image normalized to a canonical pose and an image learned from the dense layer of the previous stage. To make use of the entire face image during the process of face alignment, we additionally input at each stage a {\it landmark heatmap}, which is a key element of our system. A landmark heatmap is an image with high intensity values around landmark locations where intensity decreases with the distance from the nearest landmark. The convolutional neural network can use the heatmaps to infer the current estimates of landmark locations in the image and thus refine them. An example of a landmark heatmap can be seen in Figure~ _ref_ which shows an outline of our method. By using landmark heatmaps, our DAN algorithm is able to reduce the failure rate on the NW public test set by a large margin of N \% with respect to the state of the art. To summarize, the three main contributions of this work are the following: The remainder of the paper is organized in the following manner. In section _ref_ we give an overview of the related work. In section _ref_ we provide a detailed description of the proposed method. Finally, in section _ref_ we perform an evaluation of DAN and compare it to the state of the art.
