Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with estimates of cases and mortality increasing over the years in less developed countries then more developed ones _cite_ . Among different types, the lung cancer is the leading cause of death, except less developed countries' females. Studies in the US presented a declining of lung cancer deaths in last years (mainly in males), as a result of smoking reduction and enhancement in early diagnosis and treatment _cite_ . Nevertheless, further research is needed to decrease and control cancer cases, also for other health issues, e.g. interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) . Diagnosis of health issues is possible using data of different medical scan technologies. They may present distinct information about the body (e.g. anatomical and/or functional) . A wide-used medical exam is the X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), also commonly referred as Computed Tomography. A CT scan can present a ND structure from some part of or from the entire body, commonly used for detection of body anomalies like cancer. Thoracic area is widely scanned using CT scans to analyze the lung region, for detection of nodules (benign or malignant ones) and irregularities in the parenchyma _cite_ . Experts analyze each CT slice (a ND image of some depth from the ND scan) to evaluate the patient (e.g. to found out malignant nodules) . This evaluation can be exhaustive depending on the volume of scans analyzed and on its depth/complexity, which can reduce diagnostic reliability. Semi-and automatic approaches using computational techniques may aid experts, as a second opinion, and minimize the region of interest, thus reducing the number of slices evaluated. To increase the success not only of these approaches, but also to improve the evaluation of experts, a preprocessing step of segmentation is usually performed. In lung-related diseases, this step aims the extraction of the lung region only, removing unimportant and false-positive areas _cite_ . Diverse works aimed to segment the lung region using different and combined techniques, that goes through region growing _cite_, border analysis _cite_, shape and probabilistic models _cite_, and recently deep learning approaches _cite_ . A combination of histogram and morphological operations to extract the airspace, remove the bronchi and then segment the left and right lungs was proposed in _cite_, which have obtained a mean overlap score (between lung mask and segmentation) of _inline_eq_ in the LOLAN dataset . Another lung segmentation work _cite_ experimented on this dataset, with a _inline_eq_ mean overlap score. For experiments, they used a in-house software named yacta ('yet another CT analyzer'), which implements a region growing based method, processing each lung side. A novel robust active shape model (RASM) matching combined with a optimal surface finding method was proposed as a two-step approach for left and right lung segmentation _cite_ . Experiments with a private dataset containing N CT scans (healthy and diseased ones) achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of _inline_eq_ . Another approach is the one proposed by Nakagomi et al. _cite_ . They presented a novel shape graph cut based lung segmentation, which the best results were achieved by a multi-shape graph cut approach with Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union (IoU), of _inline_eq_ . Experiments were performed with a synthetic image and N CT scans. A wide evaluation on more than N CT scans with interstitial lung diseases and/or nodules was performed in a two-stage method based on fuzzy connectedness (FC) segmentation, detection of the rib-cage and texture features _cite_ . This approach consists in obtaining a initial segmentation of the lung parenchyma through thresholding, seed generation for the left and right lungs, then the FC segmentation. In the second stage, a random forest classification combined with space information (e.g. rib cage) was used to identify lung pathologies, hence improving the initial segmentation. Average Dice coefficient of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ for each observer were obtained in the datasets studied (excluding the LOLAN challenge dataset) . A mean overlap up to _inline_eq_ was achieved in the LOLAN dataset. Another fuzzy-based segmentation is the one proposed by Zhou et al. _cite_, which aimed to extract lungs with juxtapleural nodules. After preprocessing and thorax extraction, lung segmentation is performed using a fuzzy-c-means clustering, then refinement with iterative weighted averaging and adaptive curvature threshold. A mean IoU of _inline_eq_ was achieved, also stated that every juxtapleural nodules was included in the segmentation. Another graph cut segmentation approach is the one developed in _cite_, which uses Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and expectation maximization (EM) . After a noise-removal Gaussian smoothing, a graph representing the image is constructed, then the min-cut/max-flow algorithm is applied to segment it into foreground and background. For this segmentation, seed points for both regions are required. Thus, the authors applied the GMMs with aiding of the EM-MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) algorithm for parameter estimation (although K-means clustering is used for parameter initialization) . This approach had an average Dice of _inline_eq_ . Although Shen et al. proposed a bidirectional chain-code lung segmentation in _cite_, its focus and evaluation were based on juxtapleural nodules found in the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset. Inflection points are detected both horizontally and vertically, based on the initial segmentation. Three features from these points were extracted and used as inputs for the SVM classifier. Then, lung border is reconstructed with the positive-labeled points. Evaluation in N CT scans reported a inclusion rate of _inline_eq_ (N out of N juxtapleural nodules), with averages of under-and over-segmentation of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ respectively. Also, a control feedback system based segmentation using morphology and texture was proposed in _cite_ for analysis of N patients, which N had presence of ILDs. This approach obtained a Dice coefficient of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ for left and right lungs respectively, with an average of _inline_eq_ for both lungs. A proposed combination of incremental and constrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), named incremental constrained NMF (ICNMF), was experimented with pathological-simulated lung phantoms and also in real CT scans (a dataset with N cases and another from the LOLAN challenge) _cite_ . Having the Dice scores of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ (LOLAN dataset), the technique had shown its robustness although, as stated by the authors, exclusion of nine dense pathological scans resulted in an increasing of its score to _inline_eq_, which would suggest a lower performance in cases of this pattern. Soliman et al. _cite_ segmented the lungs through adaptive shape model, Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussian (LCDG) and Markov-Gibbs Random Fields (MGRF) . Several versions of an original CT scan are generated by Gaussian scale space filtering then, together with the original image, used as inputs for the proposed method. Each one of these scans are subjected to the generation of first (LCDG) and second-order models (spatially uniform MGRF), then combined with shape priors. At last, a majority rule merging results into the final segmentation. Attaining Dice coefficients of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_, for the UoLDB (in-house) and VESSELN datasets respectively, and an overlap of _inline_eq_ for the LOLAN dataset, being ranked first in this competition. Following the popularity of deep learning models in recent years, also in segmentation with fully convolutional networks (FCN), Harrison et al. _cite_ proposed the P-HNN (progressive holistically-nested networks) model, a FCN-based approach which uses a progressive multi-path scheme to refine its results, aiming pathological lung segmentation. Experiments were conducted in three datasets: from LTRC (Lung Tissue Research Consortium), HUG-ILD and an infection-based dataset from NIH (National Institutes of Health) . Respectively, Dice scores of _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ were attained. Table _ref_ summarizes the works reported above. Most works employed specific techniques which may not generalize to deviations from the studied samples, mainly without the presence of ILD cases. Although some works applied techniques in pathological lungs, further work is necessary to improve segmentation, since working on dense pathologies is still a challenge. Besides, popularity and promising results by deep learning approaches in many areas would incentive additional application in medical research. Hence, we propose a fully convolutional network based lung segmentation, which aims not only to segment healthy lungs, but also adapts to dense pathologies, correctly segmenting the lung region with application of more general and straightforward methods. In the next sections, we present the methodology of our work and the results obtained. Section _ref_ briefly describes the datasets studied. Our lung segmentation approach is presented in Section _ref_, then details about experiments and the results achieved by them in Section _ref_ . Finally, Section _ref_ concludes our study.
