Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved promising results in various fields of computer vision. In this paper, we tackle the problem of head pose estimation through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) . Differently from other proposals in the literature, the described system is able to work directly and based only on raw depth data. Moreover, the head pose estimation is solved as a regression problem and does not rely on visual facial features like facial landmarks. We tested our system on a well known public dataset, Biwi Kinect Head Pose, showing that our approach achieves state-of-art results and is able to meet real time performance requirements.
