Cell detection/segmentation is an essential part of automated image analysis pipelines for studying the tumour microenvironment at cell level _cite_ . This is a challenging problem due to varying size, shape and morphology of cells across the tumour landscape. Cell detection is often preferred over segmentation as it is easier to detect the cells with weak boundaries or if the nuclei are clumped together making it difficult to differentiate the boundary _cite_ . In addition, it is easier to collect ground truth data for cell detection compared to segmentation from pathologists who are already under pressure of high work load. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for cell detection in hematoxylin and eosin (H \&E) stained lung cancer images. The ground truth obtained for cell detection is usually in the form of dot annotations where each dot represents the centre of a cell. It is easier to solve cell detection as a regression problem _cite_ rather than binary classification of individual pixels which involve complex voting/encoding mechanisms _cite_ . Therefore, most of the deep learning approaches regress the probability of belonging to the centre of cell followed by local maxima detection _cite_ . Local maxima detection is comparatively easier in problems like mitotis detection where the mitotic cells are relatively far apart and probability maps are comparatively sharp _cite_ . However, when detecting cells across the tumour landscape, the probability maps are not very sharp especially for tumour cells with broken chromatin architecture where there can be multiple local maxima in the probability map. This is similar with other cell types such as fibroblasts and cartilage where width of hematoxylin channel changes through the nucleus. In these cases, a grouping distance can be defined within which there cannot be multiple detections. This parameter is difficult to tune due to large variability in the size of various cell types. Figure _ref_ illustrates different cell types in cases where there is no optimal cell size to choose for grouping distance parameter. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to solve the above discussed problem. We N. generate artificial mapped labels by convolving dot annotations with a mapping filter. N. train a CNN for mapped labels and then N. deconvolve the output of the trained CNN with the same mapping filter to retreive cell coordinates. The results show that the proposed method performs better in comparison with other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of precision and FN-Score. Traditional hand crafted feature based approches rely on morphological features such as thresholding, region growing, level sets, clustering and graph cuts _cite_ . Cosatto et al . _cite_ utilised the difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter for cell detection followed by hough transform to detect the peaks. Al-Kofahi et al . _cite_ employed graph-cut based method initialised by seeds extracted from Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter. Kuse et al . _cite_ porposed local isotropic phase symmetry for detection of beta cells in pancreas. Yuan et al . _cite_ proposed marker controlled watershed with seeds detected by thresholding. Veta et al _cite_ use fast radial symmetry transform to identify nuclei centres. Arteta et al . _cite_ utilised maximally stable extremal regions for detection of nuclei. Ali et al . _cite_ proposed active contours for cell detection and segmentation. Deep learning methods have become a method of choice due to their promising results when dealing with large data sets _cite_ . Cire»ôan et al . _cite_ presented one of the early methods utilising deep learning for mitosis detection in breast cancer images. They trained a CNN to regress probability of each pixel belonging to mitosis or non-mitosis . Cruz-Roa et al . _cite_ and Xu et al . _cite_ learn unsupervised features using auto-encoders which are fed to a classifier for cell detection. Wang et al . _cite_ extended this method by cascading CNN and hand-crafted features for mitosis detection. Xie et al . _cite_ proposed to localise nuclei centres using a voting mechanism. Sirinukunwattana et al . _cite_ proposed a spatially constrained CNN (SCCNN) by appending two extra layers to the fully connected layer. The added spatially constrained layers estimate the probabilty of a pixel being the centre of a nucleus. Kashif et al . _cite_ extended this framework by adding hand-crafted features to the input which slightly improved the FN-score and recall at the expense of precision. Chen et al . _cite_ proposed a deep regression network which learns it's parameters for a promixity map generated by the segmentation mask of mitotic cells. Wang et al . _cite_ proposed a combination of two CNNs which perform simultaneous detection and classification of cells. Xie et al . _cite_ regress a cell density map followed by local maxima detection to detect cells. Recently, Xue et al . _cite_ proposed a CNN which regresses an encoded feature vector that can be used to recover sparse cell locations. These detections are combined to get the final detection point. Xie et al . _cite_ proposed structured regression to learn proximity maps with higher values near cell centres, the local maxima provides the centre of cell location.
