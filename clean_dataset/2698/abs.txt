In this paper, we use a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for the segmentation of gliomas from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) . A fully automatic, voxel based classification was achieved by training a N layer deep FCNN on N-D slices extracted from patient volumes. The network was trained on slices extracted from N patients and validated on N patients. For the task of survival prediction, texture and shape based features were extracted from TN post contrast volume to train an XGBoost regressor. On BraTS N validation set, the proposed scheme achieved a mean whole tumor, tumor core \& active dice score of N, N \& N respectively and an accuracy of N \% for the overall survival prediction.
