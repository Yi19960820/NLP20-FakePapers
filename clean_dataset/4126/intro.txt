variety of face attributes from face images in the wild are known to be very useful in characterizing the individual characteristics. Age is one of the significant properties, which is regarded as an inherent attribute and a crucial biological characteristic, which plays a fundamental role in human social interaction. Therefore, automatic age estimation from face images is an important research content in the field of artificial intelligence. Age estimation is an available technique for many applications, which are depends on accurate age information, such as medical diagnosis (premature facial aging due to various causes), age-based human-computer interaction system, advanced video surveillance, demographic information collection, soft biometrics, etc. \par Most previous studies addressed the age prediction problem using hand-designed features with statistical models~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ . Although many traditional statistical models~ _cite_ have been proposed, hand-designed features behave unsatisfactorily on benchmarks of unconstrained images. Later research approached age estimation from face images in convolutional neural network (CNN) manner, automatically extracting feature representations for input images. There are two reasons why automatic age estimation is regarded as a very challenging task. First, discriminative feature extraction for age estimation is easily affected by large variations in facial gestures, lighting, makeup, background, noise, etc.~ _cite_ . Second, the significant similarity and subtle inter-class differences in face images with adjacent ages are hardly handled. Therefore, distinguishing age with only global features of face may not achieve better results, while searching for age-sensitive regions (wrinkles, hair, liver spots, etc.) can provide more distinctive features for age estimation. Inspired by fine-grained image categories and attention conceptions~ _cite_, we argue that combining the local features of age-sensitive regions with global features may be helpful to age estimation. In contrast to traditional fine-grained category datasets, where manual annotation of a specific part is the dominant strategy for the target, a wide array of fine-grained classification methods exist~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ and are still deployed with additional supervisory information which increases computational complexity. Currently, none of the several public large age datasets mark certain image parts, which severely limits the development of fine-grained age estimation. Therefore, there is an urgent demand on how to automatically obtain position information of age-sensitive regions. \par To solve such problems, we propose a method of fine-grained age estimation based on our attention LSTM (AL) network to improve the abilities of feature extraction. As shown in Fig.~ _ref_ (a, b), the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit is seamlessly inserted between the residual group and the fully connected layer of the residual network (ResNets) or the residual network of residual network (RoR) to form an AL-ResNets or AL-RoR network. The network is designed to effectively combine the ResNets or RoR with LSTM unit to generate feature representations on the critical age-sensitive regions. In the context of fine-grained age estimation, extracting features can be regarded as a two-level process, where one is image-level and the other one is part-level. \par Fig.~ _ref_ (c) shows the pipeline of our framework. First, to improve the performance and alleviate the over-fitting problem on small-scale datasets, we train ResNets or RoR model on ImageNet~ _cite_ ; then we fine-tune it on the IMDB-WIKI-N dataset~ _cite_ . Second, we use the model to further fine-tune it on target age datasets to extract the global features of the images. Third, on the premise of image-level features extraction, an AL-ResNets or AL-RoR network based on ResNets or RoR is constructed, where the local features of the age-sensitive regions on target images are extracted; then the final prediction results are obtained by combining the predictions of the global and local features together. Finally, through abundant experiments on several popular age datasets, our models achieved new state-of-the-art results on Adience~ _cite_, MORPH Album N~ _cite_, FG-NET~ _cite_ and N/NLAP datasets~ _cite_ ~ _cite_ . \par Our main contribution is threefold: \par N. Our method employs fine-grained categories and visual attention mechanism in the age estimation field for the first time. The proposed Attention LSTM network extracts local age-sensitive regions and more distinctive features automatically, which can effectively improve the accuracy of age estimation. \par N. The proposed Attention LSTM network has few extra parameters compared with the original CNN models and is easily trained, so our method is not only effective but also practical for age estimation. \par N. Through massive experiments, we analyzed the effects of different training strategies, network structures (ResNets and RoR) and network depths for age estimation, then developed reasonable strategies and achieved the new state-of-the-art results on different datasets. Moreover, the results of experiments based on ResNets and RoR verified the robustness of our method with different network structures. \par The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
