Deep learning has become a popular methodology in analyzing medical images such as diabetic retinopathy detection~ _cite_, classifying skin cancer~ _cite_ . Though these algorithms have proven quite accurate in classifying specific disease label and severity stage, most of them lack the ability to explain its decision, a common problem that haunts deep learning community. Lacking interpretability is especially imperative for medical image application, as physicians or doctors relies on medical evidence to determine whether to trust the machine prediction or not. In this paper, we propose a novel technique inspired by Koch's Postulates to give some insights into how convolutional neural network (CNN) based pathology detector makes decision. In particular, we take the diabetic retinopathy detection network~ _cite_ for example. Noted that not limited for ~ _cite_, this strategy could also be extended to interpret more general deep learning model. We at first apply~ _cite_ on the reference image (Fig~ _ref_ . (a)) and extract the pathological descriptor (Fig~ _ref_ . (b)) that encodes the neuron activation directly related to prediction. Picking thousand out of millions of parameters in neuron network is like separating the potential pathogen. Koch's Postulates claims that the property of pathogen, though invisible for naked eye, could be determined by observing the arose symptom after injecting it into subject. Similarly, we the pathologic descriptor into the binary vessel segmentation (Fig~ _ref_ . (c)) to synthesize the retinal image. We achieve this with a GAN based network as illustrated in Fig~ _ref_ . Given pathologic descriptor and binary vessel segmentation, our generated image (Fig~ _ref_ . (d)) exhibits the expected symptom such as microaneurysms and hard exudates that appear in the target image. Since our descriptor is lesion-based and spatial independent, we could arbitrarily manipulate the position and number of lesions. Evaluated With a panel of N licensed ophthalmologists, our generated retinal images are qualitatively and quantitatively superior to existing methods. Specifically, we encode a series of pathological descriptor as illustrated in Fig~ _ref_ . According to our analysis, the diabetic retinopathy detection network~ _cite_ predicts the diabetic level through a few dimensions (N among N, lighted with colors) of bottleneck feature in Fig~ _ref_ . We then identify the neurons that directly contribute to these N dimension bottleneck features in the activation net and record their position and activation value as the pathologic descriptor. Since neuron activation is spatially correlated with individual lesion, our descriptor is defined as lesion-based that allows us to manipulate its position and quantity. Our main contributions are mainly three-folds:
