The white cane is the most widely used blind aid tool serving mobility purposes to the visually impaired. With advancements in technology, new tools are being developed which assist the visually impaired not only with mobility, but also with better understanding of the surroundings. This paper introduces one such system that utilizes Object Recognition with Machine Learning to help blind persons recognize objects in vicinity. The act of recognizing objects without vision is a difficult task. Blind people primarily rely on their other senses for this purpose. The act of knowing what object is in front of the blind person without touching it (by hands or using some other tool) is very difficult. In some cases, the physical contact between the person and object can be dangerous, and even lethal. A computerized system that recognizes objects and gives either auditory or Braille feedback can help to great extents by giving a more accurate understanding of the environment and eliminating threats involved in the process. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in the field of image classification _cite_ . The proposed system employs a Deep CNN to recognize objects using input from a camera and processing on a portable computer system. In this paper, we describe the systemâ€™s architecture and functionality.
