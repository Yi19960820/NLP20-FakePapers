We propose a deep multitask architecture for (DMHS), including, in . The system computes the figure-ground segmentation, semantically identifies the human body parts at pixel level, and estimates the Nd and Nd pose of the person. The model supports the joint training of all components by means of multi-task losses where early processing stages recursively feed into advanced ones for increasingly complex calculations, accuracy and robustness. The design allows us to tie a complete training protocol, by taking advantage of multiple datasets that would otherwise restrictively cover only some of the model components: complex Nd image data with no body part labeling and without associated Nd ground truth, or complex Nd data with limited Nd background variability. In detailed experiments based on several challenging Nd and Nd datasets (LSP, HumanEva, N), we evaluate the sub-structures of the model, the effect of various types of training data in the multitask loss, and demonstrate that state-of-the-art results can be achieved at all processing levels. We also show that in the wild our monocular RGB architecture is perceptually competitive to a state-of-the art (commercial) Kinect system based on RGB-D data.
