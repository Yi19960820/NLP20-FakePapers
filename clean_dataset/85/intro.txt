As Self-driving cars are being introduced in major cities, intelligent traffic signs recognition has become an essential part of any autonomous driver-less vehicles _cite_ . Transitioning from a vehicle with driver to a driver-less vehicle should come in steps. The major issue seems to be the person driving the vehicle not being attentive enough to notice the traffic signs in due time. A safety harness should be placed which automates the recognition of traffic signs and alerts the driver in due time as they might suffer from fatigue or other causes _cite_ . Solving this can greatly reduce the number of casualty in major roads and highways. Orthodox computer vision techniques _cite_ and machine learning based architectures were popular for traffic sign classification _cite_, yet failed miserably to state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in recent times. Currently, deep convolutional neural networks are capable of outperforming any traditional machine learning methods for traffic sign recognition. Though many deep learning models have been proposed for traffic sign classification _cite_, they failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding overall performance for multiple traffic sign benchmarks. However, some of them scored nearly Top-N \% accuracy for a particular benchmark like GTSRB data-set _cite_, yet no further example of their models were shown for other popular benchmarks like BelgiumTS data-set _cite_ or LisaTSR benchmark _cite_ . Hence, it is evident that there is no single architecture which outperforms multiple benchmarks for Traffic Sign Recognition. It is important to mention that, a model should not be embedded on an autonomous vehicle before proving its accuracy and performance for multiple benchmark. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture. It is accompanied by hierarchical structure with customized skip connections _cite_ in steps. The skip connections are made with dilated convolutions _cite_ with different filter sizes to increase the receptive field of the feature extractors. With this architecture we reach N \% accuracy in German Traffic Sign Recognition data-set _cite_ . On the other hand, we reach N \% accuracy in Belgian Traffic Sign data-set _cite_ . Concurrently, it can be embedded to any autonomous vehicle as its reaches competitive scores on multiple benchmark.
