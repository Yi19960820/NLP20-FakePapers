Breast cancer screening in the form of annual or biennial breast X-rays is being performed to detect cancer at an early stage. This has been shown to increase chances of survival significantly, with some studies showing a reduction in breast cancer mortality of up to N \% _cite_ . Human reading of screening data is time consuming and error prone and to aid interpretation, computer aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) _cite_ systems are developed. For mammography, CAD is already widely applied as a second reader _cite_ but the effectiveness of current technology is disputed. Several studies show no increase in sensitivity or specificity with CAD _cite_ for masses or even a decreased specificity without an improvement in detection rate or characterization of invasive cancers _cite_ . During a mammographic exam, images are typically recorded of each breast and absence of a certain structure around the same location in the contra-lateral image will render an area under scrutiny more suspicious. Conversely, the presence of a similar tissue less so. Additionally, due to the annual or biennial organization of screening, there is a temporal dimension and similar principles apply: the amount of tissue is expected to decrease, rather than increase with age and therefore, novel structures that are not visible on previous exams, commonly referred to as {\it priors}, spark suspicion. In medical literature, an asymmetry denotes a potentially malignant density that is not characterized as a mass or architectural distortion. Four types are distinguished: (N) a plain {\it asymmetry} refers to a density lacking convex borders, seen in only one of the two standard mammographic views, (N) a {\it focal asymmetry} is visible on two views but does not fit the definition of a mass, (N) a {\it global asymmetry} indicates a substantial difference in total fibroglandular tissue between left and right breast, (N) a {\it developing asymmetry} refers to a growing asymmetry in comparison to prior mammograms _cite_ . These types are generally benign, but have been associated with an increased risk _cite_ and are sometimes the only manifestation of a malignancy. To the best of our knowledge, no relevant work has been done that compares reader performance of malignancies with and without left and right comparisons, but asymmetry is often mentioned by clinicians as an important clue, also to detect malignancies that are classified as a mass. The merit of temporal comparison mammograms on the other hand has been well studied and is generally known to improve specificity without a profound impact on sensitivity for detection _cite_ . Burnside et al. _cite_ analyzed a set of diagnostic and screening mammograms and concluded that in the latter case, comparison with previous examinations significantly decreases the recall rate and false positive rate, but does not increase sensitivity. Varela et al. _cite_ compared the reading performance of six readers and found the performance drops significantly when removing the prior mammogram, in particular in areas of high specificity, relevant for screening. Roelofs et al. _cite_ also investigated the merit of prior mammograms in both detection and assessment of malignant lesions. Their results show performance was significantly better in the presence of a prior exam, but no more lesions were found. They subsequently postulate priors are predominantly useful for interpretation and less so for initial detection. Yankakis et al. _cite_ additionally investigate the effect of noticeable change in tissue in mammograms. They generated separate sets of current-prior examination pairs with and without noticeable change and observed that recall rate, sensitivity and cancer detection rate (CDR) are higher when change is noted, but specificity is lower, resulting in a higher false positive rate. Symmetry is often used as a feature in traditional CAD systems detecting pathologies such as lesions in the brain _cite_, prostate cancer _cite_ and abnormalities in the lungs _cite_ . Most research on mammographic asymmetries involves the classification of a holistic notion of discrepancy rather than the incorporation of this information in a CAD system _cite_ . Published work on temporal analysis typically relies on the extraction of features from both current and prior exams which are combined into a single observation and fed to a statistical learning algorithm _cite_ . For detection, an additional registration step is performed _cite_ . This has been shown to significantly increase performance of the traditional, handcrafted feature based systems. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning _cite_ signified a breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) and several pattern recognition applications are now claiming human or even super human performance _cite_ . Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) _cite_ are currently dominating leader boards in challenges for both natural _cite_ and medical image analysis challenges _cite_ . Rather than relying on engineers and domain experts to design features, the systems learn feature transformations from data, saving enormous amounts of time in development. The adoption of deep neural networks in medical image analysis was initially reluctant, but the community has recently seen a surge of papers _cite_ some showing significant improvements upon the state-of-the art _cite_ . The vanilla CNN architecture is a generic problem solver for many signal processing tasks but is still limited by the constraint that a single tensor needs to be fed to the front-end layer, if no further adaptations to the network are made. Medical images provide an interesting new data source, warranting adaptation of methods successful in natural images. Several alternative architectures that go beyond the patch level and work with multi-scale _cite_ or video _cite_ have been explored for natural scenes. In these settings, multiple datastreams are employed, where each datastream represents, for instance, a different scale in the image or frames at different time points in a video. Similar ideas have been applied to medical data, most notably the N simplification of volumetric scans _cite_ . In this paper we extend previous work _cite_ and investigate the addition of symmetry and temporal information to a deep CNN with the purpose of detecting malignant soft tissue lesions in mammography. We employ a simple linear mapping that takes the location of a mass candidate and maps it to either the contra-lateral or prior mammogram and regions of interest (ROI) are extracted around each location. We subsequently explore two different architectures Examples of symmetry pairs are show in figure _ref_ . Figure _ref_ shows several examples of temporal pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CAD and deep learning approach incorporating symmetry as a feature in a CAD system and the first CAD paper exploring deep neural networks for temporal comparison. Even though the methods are applied to mammography, we feel results may be relevant as well for other medical image analysis tasks, where classification of anomalies that occur unilaterally or develop over time is important, such as lung, prostate and brain images. The rest of this paper is divided into N sections. In the following section, we will outline the data pre-processing, candidate detector and linear mapping used. In section N the deep neural architectures will be described followed by a description of the data and experimental setup in section N. Results will be discussed in section N and we will end with a conclusion in section N.
