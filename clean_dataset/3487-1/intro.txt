Deep learning has developed rapidly recently due to the availability of large scale of labeled data, and High Performance Computing. Deep learning is currently one of the most popular machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) _cite_ . In computer vision, many classical techniques of feature extraction and subspace learning have been eclipsed due to the recent promising good performance in deep learning. Deep learning is promising to allow for the full utilization of large datasets in order to solve machine learning problems. Traditionally, good results have been obtained using combinations of classifiers, regressors, hand-crafted features, facial landmarks, and dimensionality reduction _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . Neural networks, however, have taken the scene with their ability to learn and memorize features, and keep improving in accuracy as more data are observed. Thus Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have far surpassed traditional classification and regression techniques, and have even surpassed human performance on a number of well-known benchmarks _cite_ _cite_ . Amongst the different types of deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to be very effective for human demographics estimation _cite_ . This paper studies the use of transfer learning to tackle the problem of recognizing a person's age and gender from an image using deep convolutional neural networks. A variety of network designs and training techniques are explored.
