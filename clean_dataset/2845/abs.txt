In this work, we propose advanced pneumonia and Tuberculosis grading system for X-ray images. The proposed system is a very deep fully convolutional classification network with online augmentation that outputs confidence values for diseases prevalence. Itâ€™s a fully automated system capable of disease feature understanding without any offline preprocessing step or manual feature extraction. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the public databases such as ChestXray-N, Mendeley, Shenzhen Hospital X-ray and Belarus X-ray set.
