Computing image patch correspondences based on local descriptor matching is important in many computer vision problems such as image retrieval, wide baseline stereo matching and panorama building. The main challenge of finding correct correspondences is that the appearance of the image patches varies due to changes of scaling, view angle, illumination and imaging condition etc. Designing local feature descriptors that are invariant to such changes is therefore essential. Efforts of local descriptor fall into two categories: hand-crafted and learning-based. Hand-crafted descriptors try to achieve the invariance by manually selected rules. One of the most popular hand-crafted descriptors is SIFT~ _cite_ and its variants ~ _cite_, which are widely used in the computer vision community. The main issue of the hand-crafted descriptors is that they can only consider a limited predefined set of variations. One approach to take all variations into consideration is learning local descriptors from a large patch correspondence dataset~ _cite_ . The state-of-the-art descriptor learning methods are based on neural networks _cite_ . In addition to the model itself, the most important aspect of learning-based method is the loss function which defines the goal of descriptor learning: matching patches should be close in the descriptor space, while the non-matching patches should be far-away . The pairwise loss and triplet loss (Section _ref_) are the commonly used loss functions to achieve the desired properties. Recently, there are a lot of works such as smart sampling strategies~ _cite_ and structured loss~ _cite_ that improve the triplet loss. In particular, Kumar \etal~ _cite_ propose to use a global loss to separate the distance distributions of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs. This approach avoids the design of complicated sampling strategies and is also shown to provide results that are robust to training with outliers. The success of global loss motivates us to further explore the desired properties of the descriptor space and design a robust regularization term based on these properties. Our main idea is that the good local feature descriptors should be sufficiently ``spread-out'' in the descriptor space in order to fully utilize the expressive power of the space. Specifically, we introduce a regularization term that induces the spread-out condition, inspired by the properties of the uniform distribution on unit sphere (Section _ref_) . The regularization can be easily used to improve all methods where pairwise or triplet loss is used. We show that the proposed regularization with triplet loss, without hard sample mining, outperforms all the Euclidean distance based descriptors by a large margin (Section _ref_) . In particular, it outperforms the global loss~ _cite_ in the patch pair classification task. As an extension of descriptor learning, we show that the proposed regularization can also be used in improving image-level deep feature embedding (Section _ref_) .
