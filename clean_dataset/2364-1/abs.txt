When classifying LiDAR point clouds, a large amount of time is devoted to the process of engineering a reliable set of features which later is passed to a classifier of choice. Generally, such features-usually derived from the ND covariance matrix-are computed using the surrounding neighboring points. The size of the neighborhood is either predefined or found automatically per point before estimating the features. While the features capture different aspects of the point and the corresponding neighborhood, the process is usually time consuming and requires the application at multiple scales combined with contextual methods in order to capture complete objects. In this paper we present a ND fully convolutional network that consumes terrain-normalized LiDAR points directly with the corresponding spectral data to generate point-wise labeling without using contextual methods. Our method only uses the ND-coordinates along with three spectral features extracted from ND georeferenced IR-R-G images. We train our network by splitting the data into blocks, and we show that our method doesn't depend on the order of the points within the block due to the nature of used pooling layer. We train and evaluate our model using the ISRPS ND Semantic Labeling Challange. Our method scored second place with an overall accuracy of N \%. We ranked third place with a mean FN-score of N \%, surpassing the FN-score of the method with highest accuracy by N \%. In addition to labeling LiDAR points, we also show that our method can be easily extended and generates promising results when applied to ND semantic segmentation tasks.
