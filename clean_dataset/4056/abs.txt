Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made impressive progress in many video recognition tasks such as video pose estimation and video object detection. However, CNN inference on video is computationally expensive due to processing dense frames individually. In this work, we propose a framework called Recurrent Residual Module (RRM) to accelerate the CNN inference for video recognition tasks. This framework has a novel design of using the similarity of the intermediate feature maps of two consecutive frames, to largely reduce the redundant computation. One unique property of the proposed method compared to previous work is that feature maps of each frame are precisely computed. The experiments show that, while maintaining the similar recognition performance, our RRM yields averagely N _inline_eq_ acceleration on the commonly used CNNs such as AlexNet, ResNet, deep compression model (thus N _inline_eq_ N _inline_eq_ faster than the original dense models using the efficient inference engine), and impressively N _inline_eq_ acceleration on some binary networks such as XNOR-Nets (thus N _inline_eq_ faster than the original model) . We further verify the effectiveness of the RRM on speeding up CNNs for video pose estimation and video object detection.
