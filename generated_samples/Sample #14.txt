<|startoftext|> In this paper, we use a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for the segmentation of gliomas from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) . A fully automatic, voxel based classification was achieved by training a N layer deep FCNN on N-D slices extracted from patient volumes. The network was trained on slices extracted from N patients and validated on N patients. For the task of survival prediction, texture and shape based features were extracted from TN post contrast volume to train an XGBoost regressor. On BraTS N validation set, the proposed scheme achieved a mean whole tumor, tumor core \& active dice score of N, N \& N respectively and an accuracy of N \% for the overall survival prediction. <|endoftext|>
 
 
  <|startoftext|> Gliomas are the most commonly diagnosed neurological disorder in the elderly. Gliomas are characterized by the most common type of gliomas, including the gliomas with a large volume and the gliomas that are small and non-visceral. They have a high risk of developing cancer and can lead to death _cite_. Gliomas are a very common cause of blindness in the elderly and can cause irreversible damage in the brain and spinal cord _cite_. The gliomas are also known to have a high risk of cancer and can cause irreversible damage in the brain and spinal cord _cite_. The diagnosis and treatment of the gliomas can be made by a specialist with a specialist trained in the area of interest. However, the amount of time and effort required to develop a diagnosis and treatment strategy for the patient is extremely time consuming and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for the segmentation of gliomas from MR images. The FCNN was trained on N-D slices extracted from N patients and validated on N patients. The network was trained on the patient volume and was evaluated on a subset of N patients and evaluated on a subset of N patients. The network was evaluated on the patient segmentation and the overall survival of the patient.<|endoftext|>
