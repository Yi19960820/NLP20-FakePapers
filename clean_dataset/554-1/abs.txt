Cluster of microcalcifications can be an early sign of breast cancer. In this paper we propose a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks for the detection and segmentation of microcalcification clusters. In this work we used N mammograms to train and validate our model, obtaining an accuracy of N \% in the detection of preliminary suspect regions and of N \% in the segmentation task. Our results show how deep learning could be an effective tool to effectively support radiologists during mammograms examination.
