Time-Spatial data plays a crucial role for different fields such as traffic management. These data can be collected via devices such as surveillance sensors or tracking systems. However, how to efficiently analyze and visualize these data to capture essential embedded pattern information is becoming a big challenge today. Classic visualization approaches focus on revealing ND and ND spatial information and modeling statistical test. Those methods would easily fail when data become massive. Recent attempts concern on how to simply cluster data and perform prediction with time-oriented information. However, those approaches could still be further enhanced as they also have limitations for handling massive clusters and labels. In this paper, we propose a visualization methodology for mobility data using artificial neural net techniques. This method aggregates three main parts that are Back-end Data Model, Neural Net Algorithm including clustering method Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and prediction approach Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) for extracting the features and lastly a solid front-end that displays the results to users with an interactive system. SOM is able to cluster the visiting patterns and detect the abnormal pattern. RNN can perform the prediction for time series analysis using its dynamic architecture. Furthermore, an interactive system will enable user to interpret the result with graphics, animation and ND model for a close-loop feedback. This method can be particularly applied in two tasks that Commercial-based Promotion and abnormal traffic patterns detection.
