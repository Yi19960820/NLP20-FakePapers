Compressed learning _cite_ is a mathematical framework that combines compressed sensing _cite_ with machine learning. In contrast to compressed sensing, the goal of CL is inference from the signal rather than signal reconstruction. In the CL framework, the measurement device acquires the signal in the linear projections domain, and the inference is performed in the low-dimensional measurements domain using machine learning tools. CL has diverse applications including compressive image classification _cite_, reconstruction-free action recognition _cite_, compressive acquisition of dynamic scenes _cite_, compressive least-squares regression _cite_, compressive watermark detection _cite_, compressive prediction of proteinâ€“protein interactions _cite_, compressive targets classification _cite_, and compressive hyperspectral image analysis _cite_ . In this paper we present an end-to-end deep learning _cite_ solution to the CL problem, and the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated for the task of image classification _cite_ . The main novelty of the proposed approach is that the sensing matrix is jointly optimized with the inference operator. This is in contrast to previous works, which decouple the sensing matrix choice from the inference operator, and employ standard compressed sensing matrices. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (N) It presents for the first time, to the best knowledge of the authors, the utilization of a deep neural network for the tasks of compressive linear sensing and non-linear inference; and (N) During training, the proposed network optimizes the compressive sensing matrix and the inference operator, leading to a significant advantage compared to state-of-the-art for the task of image classification. This paper is organized as follows: section _ref_ reviews compressed sensing and learning concepts. Section _ref_ presents the end-to-end deep learning approach, and discusses structure and training aspects. Section _ref_ evaluates the performance of the proposed approach for compressively classify images, and compares it with state-of-the-art. Section _ref_ concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.
