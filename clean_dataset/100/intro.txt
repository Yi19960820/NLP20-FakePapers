Long scan time is a primary disadvantage of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) . Parallel imaging (PI) techniques have become popular strategies for reducing MRI scan time. Two conventional PI reconstruction algorithms are the SENSE [] and the generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) [] . On the other hand, compressed sensing (CS)-based methods [] seek to exploit intrinsic image properties of sparsity in a transform domain and have allowed for accelerated imaging in some settings. These techniques can be formulated similarly to a regularized SENSE reconstruction, but use different regularization strategies to increase data acquisition speed while generating better reconstructions. However, recent data-driven methods based on deep learning has resulted in promising improvements in image reconstruction algorithms. Two primary deep neural networks-based MRI reconstruction frameworks include image-domain-based [] and _inline_eq_-space-based [] frameworks. In [], the authors used the convolutional neural network (CNN) either as an initialization or a regularization term for constrained reconstruction. In [], a cascade of CNNs is presented and trained, and the reconstruction process is considered as a de-aliasing problem in the image domain. In [], a variational network reconstruction method is presented and trained for accelerated multi-coil MRI data. In [], a deep network is applied entirely in the _inline_eq_-space domain to utilize known properties in different ways to compensate for missing _inline_eq_-space data. On the other hand, the method presented in [] exploited the combination of fully connected layers plus convolutional autoencoder in order to find the direct mapping from the _inline_eq_-space domain into the image domain and trained their network with data that modulated with synthesized-phase. In all the mentioned papers, the deep network needs to learn from new massive training datasets acquired under new configurations through the training process every time from scratch in order to be able to reconstruct efficiently. Not being able to generalize to new datasets is the main disadvantage of these type of methods which make them unsuitable in practice especially since a wide range of MR system and protocols exists. The deep learning-based reconstruction methods are sensitive to any deviation between training and test datasets. Especially an SNR deviation between training and test datasets will leads to a considerable reduction of image quality [] . Also, any changes in _inline_eq_-space sampling pattern will result in an immediate failure for any learning-based reconstruction method. Since having different acquisition parameters in MRI systems are very common between different institutions, the learning-based approaches are not considered as practical solutions for MRI reconstruction. Here, we propose a new generalized parallel imaging method based on deep neural networks without using any training datasets. Unlike most deep learning-based MRI reconstruction methods, our method operates on real-world acquisitions with the complex data format, not on simulated data, real-valued data, or data with added simulated-phase. We categorize our method among the unsupervised energy-based methods [] . Using our proposed method, we evaluate the reconstruction performance compared to clinically-used GRAPPA reconstruction method and the recently published deep learning-based variational network (VN) method.
