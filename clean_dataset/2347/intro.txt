Hand-drawn sketches have been effective tools for communication from the ancient times. With the advancements in technology, e.g., touch screen devices, sketching has become much easier and convenient way of communication in the modern era. Moreover, sketch recognition has numerous applications in many real-world areas, examples include education, human-computer interaction, sketch-based search and game design. Considering its importance, research on sketch recognition~ _cite_, sketch-to-image retrieval~ _cite_ and facial sketch recognition~ _cite_ have gained huge interest in past few years. In this work, we aim to recognize hand-drawn sketch images. It is a challenging task due to following. (i) sketches are abstract description of objects (Fig.~ _ref_ (a)), (ii) sketches have large intra-class variation and large inter-class similarity (Fig.~ _ref_ (b)), and (iii) sketches lack visual cues, e.g., absence of color and texture (Fig.~ _ref_ (c)) . Overcoming these challenges to some extent Yu~ \el~ _cite_ and more recently He~ \el~ _cite_ have shown promising performance on sketch recognition. Despite these successful models the problem is far from being solved for real-life applications. We address the sketch recognition problem by designing robust and category-agnostic representation of sketches using a novel deep metric learning technique. Our proposed method is inspired by the classical Bayesian decision theory~ _cite_ . Given a deep neural network _inline_eq_ where _inline_eq_ is a set of sketches, and _inline_eq_ is a _inline_eq_-dimensional representation of _inline_eq_ th sketch, let _inline_eq_ be the distance between two samples. Further, suppose _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ are classes containing all positive and negative samples respectively, and _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ are the class conditional probabilities given distance between embeddings of two samples _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ . Now, given these probabilities the Bayesian risk of misclassifying pair of positive samples as negative and the vice-versa, can be easily estimated~ _cite_ . We use this risk as a loss and minimize it to learn better representations for sketch images. The learnt representations obtained using this loss function is robust and a na \"ive linear classifier on these embeddings yields us state-of-the-art performance on sketch recognition. The contributions of our work are as follows. This paper is organized as follows. In Section~ _ref_ we provide a literature survey related to sketch recognition problem and deep metric learning. We then formally describe our loss function in Section~ _ref_ . We then show results on public benchmarks, provide extensive discussions on our results in Section~ _ref_ and ablation study in Section~ _ref_ . We finally conclude our work in Section~ _ref_ .
