Annotating the right data for training deep neural networks is an important challenge. Active learning using uncertainty estimates from Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) could provide an effective solution to this. Despite being theoretically principled, BNNs require approximations to be applied to large-scale problems, where both performance and uncertainty estimation are crucial. In this paper, we introduce Deep Probabilistic Ensembles (DPEs), a scalable technique that uses a regularized ensemble to approximate a deep BNN. We conduct a series of large-scale visual active learning experiments to evaluate DPEs on classification with the CIFAR-N, CIFAR-N and ImageNet datasets, and semantic segmentation with the BDDNk dataset. Our models require significantly less training data to achieve competitive performances, and steadily improve upon strong active learning baselines as the annotation budget is increased.
