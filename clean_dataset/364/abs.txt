Hackers and spammers are employing innovative and novel techniques to deceive novice and even knowledgeable internet users. Image spam is one of such technique where the spammer varies and changes some portion of the image such that it is indistinguishable from the original image fooling the users. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for image spam detection using the convolutional neural networks which uses a dataset with N natural images and N spam images for classification achieving an accuracy of N \% outperforming the existing image processing and machine learning techniques.
