For realistic automated gender classification system, facial images taken in unconstrained environmental conditions (e.g., CCTV and video cameras) have to be considered. This is an important challenge for the gender classification in the wild for obvious reasons such as low image quality caused by blurring, illumination variations and low resolution that can severely affect the system performance. In recent years, due to the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in pattern recognition area, the gender classification has applied DNN and showed the promising results in the various conditions _cite_ . However, besides above challenging environmental conditions, the performance of the gender classification is affected by facial aging effect, which changes the discriminative facial features over age.~In general, the facial features characterizing a gender change as a person advances in age.~In Fig.~ _ref_ ~ (a), it is clear that the skin difference between the male and female can be prominently attributed to factors such as skin color, existence of beard, and thickness of eyebrows.~However, as the number and size of wrinkles and dark spots on faces increase as a person ages, the distinction in facial appearance between male and female becomes less obvious (see Fig.~ _ref_ ~ (b)) .~The empirical study of facial aging effect to the gender classification was shown in Guo \etal _cite_, which reported that the gender classification performance deteriorates for young and senior age groups. Although the previous gender classifications using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have shown prominent classification accuracy in low quality images captured under unconstrained conditions, the negative effect of facial aging to the gender classification has not been considered yet.~Therefore, to overcome this issue, we propose deep gender classification method composed of multi-experts specialized in different age groups.~Each expert is constructed by combining two deep networks; the first one, referred as Convolutional Appearance Network (CAN), is CNN implemented to focus on facial appearance feature, and the second network, Deep Geometry Network (DGN), is a DNN designed for facial shape feature.~In the CAN, the lightweight CNN is utilized, because the gender classification does not require complex and deep architecture.~The second network DGN is proposed to extract the discriminative facial shape features robust to facial pose variation due to utilization of half of face. Through the model integration strategy, CAN and DGN are joint fine-tuned to improve overall performance. In the previous gender classification researches (not deep learning based), the facial geometric features have been utilized for both age and gender classification _cite_, and the performance was improved when they are incorporated with the facial appearance features.~Furthermore, apart from facial appearance features, the facial shape changes subtly after young age; thus facial shape feature can be exploited as a signature to resolve facial aging effect of the gender classification.~To the best of our knowledge, the facial geometric feature has not been adopted in the previous DNN-based gender classification researches, so the further performance improvement is expected when the proposed DGN is utilized. The proposed method, referred as multi-expert gender classification on age group (MGA), is not limited to only gender classification, but also designed to predict age of facial image simultaneously.~The main purpose of MGA is focused on improving the performance of the gender classification, but the proposed method is exploited for joint age estimation and gender classification.~In general, multi-task learning schemes for facial age and gender classifications are based on CNN architecture which shares some layers and achieve better performance than training a single task one by one _cite_ .~However, they are nothing more than sharing same layers without any compensation among correlated tasks.~Different from the previous joint age estimation and gender classification, the proposed MGA utilizes the result of age prediction to make gender decision. Therefore, the major contributions of this paper are as follows: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: ~Section N illustrates the related works.~Section N describes the architecture of CAN, DGN and the proposed integrated network.~Section N explains the architecture of the proposed multi-expert gender classifications on age groups.~Section N presents our experimental results.~Finally, Section N concludes by summarizing and outlining future works.
