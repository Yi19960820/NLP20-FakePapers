We propose a novel ND shape parameterization by surface patches, that are oriented by ND mesh quadrangulation of the shape. By encoding ND surface detail on local patches, we learn a patch dictionary that identifies principal surface features of the shape. Unlike previous methods, we are able to encode surface patches of variable size as determined by the user. We propose novel methods for dictionary learning and patch reconstruction based on the query of a noisy input patch with holes. We evaluate the patch dictionary towards various applications in ND shape inpainting, denoising and compression. Our method is able to predict missing vertices and inpaint moderately sized holes. We demonstrate a complete pipeline for reconstructing the ND mesh from the patch encoding. We validate our shape parameterization and reconstruction methods on both synthetic shapes and real world scans. We show that our patch dictionary performs successful shape completion of complicated surface textures.
