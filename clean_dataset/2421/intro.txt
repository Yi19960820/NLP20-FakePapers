Images taken in outdoor environments affected by air pollution, dust, mist, and fumes often contain complicated, non-linear, and data-dependent noise, also known as haze. Haze complicates many high-level computer vision tasks such as object detection and recognition. Therefore, dehazing has been widely studied in the fields of computational photography and computer vision. Early dehazing approaches often required additional information such as the provision or capture of scene depth by comparing several different images of the same scene~ _cite_ . Many approaches have since been proposed to exploit natural image priors and to perform statistical analyses~ _cite_ . Most recently, dehazing algorithms based on neural networks _cite_ have delivered state-of-the-art performance. For example, AOD-Net _cite_ trains an end-to-end system and shows superior performance according to multiple evaluation metrics, improving object detection in the haze using end-to-end training of dehazing and detection modules.
