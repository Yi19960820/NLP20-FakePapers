<|startoftext|> We propose a method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using an adversarial network. While most existing discriminators are trained to classify input images as real or fake on the image level, we design a discriminator in a fully convolutional manner to differentiate the predicted probability maps from the ground truth segmentation distribution with the consideration of the spatial resolution. We show that the proposed discriminator can be used to improve semantic segmentation accuracy by coupling the adversarial loss with the standard cross entropy loss of the proposed model. In addition, the fully convolutional discriminator enables semi-supervised learning through discovering the trustworthy regions in predicted results of unlabeled images, thereby providing additional supervisory signals. In contrast to existing methods that utilize weakly-labeled images, our method leverages unlabeled images to enhance the segmentation model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC N and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. <|endoftext|>
 
 
  <|startoftext|> The ability to automatically segment and segment the visual information from a large set of images has been widely studied in the field of computer vision _cite_, with the goal of improving the performance of a computer vision system by automatically segmenting a set of images into classes, such as ``supervised'' or ``supervised classification, and then classifying them into classes, such as ``supervised'' or ``supervised classification, and then classifying them into classes, such as ``supervised'' or ``supervised classification, as a whole, and so on. This is achieved by using a discriminator that is trained to recognize a set of images as a whole, such as a classifier, and that learns the discriminator to recognize classes, such as ``classifiers''. The discriminator learns to recognize the classes by exploiting the information from the image level, such as a classifier, a classifier, and a classifier that is trained to recognize the classes by exploiting the information from the image level. In this way, the discriminator learns to distinguish the class from the class, and to learn to distinguish the classes from the class. The main contributions of this work are as the following. (a) We propose to use the generative adversarial network (GAN) for the semi-supervised semantic segmentation of a dataset of unlabeled images. (b) We introduce the discriminator that is trained to recognize the classes by exploiting the information from the image level, such as a classifier, a classifier, and a classifier that is trained to recognize the classes by exploiting the information from the image level. In this way, the discriminator learns to differentiate the classes from the class, and to learn to distinguish the classes from the class.
