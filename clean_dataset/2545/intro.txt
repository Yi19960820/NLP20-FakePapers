Structured data-based learning has become a central topic in machine learning, as such data representations are met in numerous fields. We focus here on tree-based representations, whose typical applications are parse trees in Natural Language Processing _cite_, XML trees in web mining _cite_, or even hierarchical image representations _cite_ . Since tree structure plays an important role in tasks like classification or clustering, similarity measures taking explicitly into account topological characteristics of the tree are sought. Among them, kernels functions are appealing as they allow the use of popular kernel methods _cite_ . Various kernels have indeed been proposed to cope with a tree as the underlying data structure (see _cite_ for a review) . They mostly rely on a fundamental idea brought by Haussler with its convolution kernels _cite_, stating that a kernel defined on a complex structure can be formed by kernels computed on its substructures. Most often, those kernels are defined for ordered trees, that is to say trees for which left to right order among nodes or leaves is fixed (mostly because of the specific nature of the data or due to computational complexity issues) . Examples of such kernels include the subset tree kernel _cite_ and the subtree kernel _cite_ . Unordered trees received much less attention, with the subpath kernel _cite_ being one of the very few existing solutions. Meanwhile, an emerging paradigm for image classification has advocated the idea of relying on hierarchical representations _cite_, which are built using series of nested partitions or segmentations, rather than the usual flat representation. This is particularly true in remote sensing, where such representations allow for revealing different objects of interest at various scales through a tree structure. However, the induced trees are unordered and the nodes or regions are associated with numerical features, preventing the use of existing tree kernels. We propose in this paper a new kernel that arises from the subpath kernel _cite_ . Based on some existing adaptations to numerical data from the graph kernel literature, the designed kernel is able to cope with unordered trees equipped with numerical data (see Sec.~ _ref_) . Besides, it considers the complete set of subpaths on tree structures (instead of paths on graphs), leading to an efficient computation scheme. Experimental results are given in Sec.~ _ref_ . They rely on artificial datasets as well as a real multispectral satellite image. We end the paper with some concluding remarks and directions for future work.
