Visual object tracking has actively been researched for several decades. Depending on the prior information about the target category, the tracking algorithms are usually classified as {\em category-free methods}, like KCF~ _cite_, Struck~ _cite_, LGT~ _cite_, and {\em category-based} methods, like human tracking~ _cite_, vehicle tracking~ _cite_, hand tracking~ _cite_ . The category-free tracking methods are acknowledged for their simple initialisation (a single bounding box) and easy generalisation across different object categories. They have extensively been studied and compared~ _cite_ . However, as those methods have no prior information about the {\em target} inside the bounding box, the tracking performance heavily depends on the heuristic assumptions of image regions, i.e., appearance consistency~ _cite_ and motion consistency~ _cite_, which fail when those assumptions are not met. In contrast, the category-based methods benefit from the prior information about the target and can better adjust the target model and predict its dynamics or appearance variations during tracking. Those category-based methods can achieve superior performance on a specific category but usually have difficulties being generalised to other object categories. As many sophisticated machine learning algorithms have recently been adopted for tracking~ _cite_, an interesting question is whether we can build a~ semantic tracker, based on those methods, to bridge the gap between the category-free tracking methods and category-based tracking methods (see Tab.~ _ref_) . Early attempts to track and recognise the objects simultaneously were done by~ _cite_ . However, the aforementioned works were developed using conventional hand-crafted features, which have difficulties of being scaled up. Inspired by the recent success of convolutional networks~ _cite_, we propose, in this article, a~ semantic tracker with a unified convolutional framework which encodes generic features across different object categories while also captures category-based features for model adaptation during tracking. With the help of the {\em category-classification network}, the semantic tracker can avoid heuristic assumptions about the tracked objects. The proposed semantic tracker comprises three stages: off-line training, online tracking, and network adaptation. It consists of a shared convolutional network (NetS), a classification network (NetC) and a tracking network (NetT), see Fig.~ _ref_ . In the off-line training stage, NetS is pre-trained from ImageNet to extract generic features across different object categories. Those features are then fed into NetC for classification and NetT for tracking. Note that NetT has multiple branches to distinguish the tracked object from the background. Since each branch is trained by the videos of a specific object category, this enables each branch in NetT to learn the category-specific features related to both foreground and background, e.g., when tracking a pedestrian, it is more likely to learn the features of a car in the background than features of a fish. During online tracking, NetC first recognises the object category and activates the corresponding branch in NetT. Then, NetT is automatically fine-tuned for that particular tracking video by exploiting the foreground and the background sample regions in the first frame. When a new image frame arrives, the algorithm samples a set of image regions and each sample is fed through both NetC and NetT. The regions with the right category and the foreground label are used for target estimation (i.e., the location and the size of the target bounding box) . Note that the target appearance often changes during the tracking, therefore it is extremely crucial for a tracker to adapt the model accordingly. To improve the robustness and precision, NetC and NetT inter-supervise each other and trigger network adaptation when their outputs are ambiguous (i.e., not consistent) for several image regions, e.g., when an image region is classified as a non-target category from NetC but as foreground from NetT or as a target category from NetC and background from NetT. The samples with consistent labellings are used to update the networks which also results in a reduced number of ambiguous sample regions. We have evaluated the contribution of each key component to the overall performance on OTB tracking benchmark~ _cite_ (N sequences), and also compared the whole algorithm to the other state-of-the-art single-target tracking algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm as it outperformed other N state-of-the-art tracking algorithms not only overall, but also on the sub-datasets annotated with specific attributes. Different from conventional category-free and category-based trackers, the main contributions of our semantic tracker can be summarised as: The rest of the paper is organised as follows.
