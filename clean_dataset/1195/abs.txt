We have developed an automatic sleep stage classification algorithm based on deep residual neural networks and raw polysomnogram signals. Briefly, the raw data is passed through N convolutional layers before subsequent classification into one of five sleep stages. Three model configurations were trained on N polysomnogram recordings and subsequently tested on N independent recordings. Our best performing model yielded an accuracy of N \% and a Cohen's kappa of N, improving on previous reported results by other groups also using only raw polysomnogram data. Most errors were made on non-REM stage N and N decisions, errors likely resulting from the definition of these stages. Further testing on independent cohorts is needed to verify performance for clinical use.
