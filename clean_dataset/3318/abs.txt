Present world has already been consistently exploring the fine edges of online and digital world by imposing multiple challenging problems/scenarios. Similar to physical world, personal identity management is very crucial in-order to provide any secure online system. Last decade has seen a lot of work in this area using biometrics such as face, fingerprint, iris etc. Still there exist several vulnerabilities and one should have to address the problem of compromised biometrics much more seriously, since they cannot be modified easily once compromised. In this work, we have proposed a secure cancelable finger dorsal template generation network (learning domain specific features) secured via. Bio-Hashing. Proposed system effectively protects the original finger dorsal images by withdrawing compromised template and reassigning the new one. A novel Finger-Dorsal Feature Extraction Net (FDFNet) has been proposed for extracting the discriminative features. This network is exclusively trained on trait specific features without using any kind of pre-trained architecture. Later Bio-Hashing, a technique based on assigning a tokenized random number to each user, has been used to hash the features extracted from FDFNet. To test the performance of the proposed architecture, we have tested it over two benchmark public finger knuckle datasets: PolyU FKP and PolyU Contactless FKI. The experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of security and accuracy.
