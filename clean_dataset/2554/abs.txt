Advancements in deep learning over the years have attracted research into how deep artificial neural networks can be used in robotic systems. It is on this basis that the following research survey will present a discussion of the applications, gains, and obstacles to deep learning in comparison to physical robotic systems while using modern research as examples. The research survey will present a summarization of the current research with specific focus on the gains and obstacles in comparison to robotics. This will be followed by a primer on discussing how notable deep learning structures can be used in robotics with relevant examples. The next section will show the practical considerations robotics researchers desire to use in regard to deep learning neural networks. Finally, the research survey will show the shortcomings and solutions to mitigate them in addition to discussion of the future trends. The intention of this research is to show how recent advancements in the broader robotics field can inspire additional research in applying deep learning in robotics.
