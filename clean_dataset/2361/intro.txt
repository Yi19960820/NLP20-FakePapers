Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) version of a low-resolution (LR) input. As a classical problem, SISR is still an active yet challenging research topic in the field of computer vision due to its ill-poseness nature and high practical values~ _cite_ . In the typical SISR framework, an LR image _inline_eq_ is modeled as the output of the following degradation process: where _inline_eq_ represents the convolution between a blur kernel _inline_eq_ and a latent HR image _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ is a subsequent downsampling operation with scale factor _inline_eq_, and _inline_eq_ usually is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with standard deviation (noise level) _inline_eq_ . SISR methods can be broadly classified into three categories, \ie, interpolation-based methods, model-based optimization methods and discriminative learning methods. Interpolation-based methods such as nearest-neighbor, bilinear and bicubic interpolators are simple and efficient but have very limited performance. By exploiting powerful image priors (\eg, the non-local self-similarity prior~ _cite_, sparsity prior~ _cite_ and denoiser prior~ _cite_), model-based optimization methods are flexible to reconstruct relative high-quality HR images, but they usually involve a time-consuming optimization procedure. Although the integration of convolutional neural network (CNN) denoiser prior and model-based optimization can improve the efficiency to some extent, it still suffers from the typical drawbacks of model-based optimization methods, \eg, it is not in an end-to-end learning manner and involves hand-designed parameters~ _cite_ . As an alternative, discriminative learning methods have attracted considerable attentions due to their favorable SISR performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, recent years have witnessed a dramatic upsurge of using CNN for SISR. In this paper, we focus on discriminative CNN methods for SISR so as to exploit the merits of CNN, such as the fast speed by parallel computing, high accuracy by end-to-end training, and tremendous advances in training and designing networks~ _cite_ . While several SISR models based on discriminative CNN have reported impressive results, they suffer from a common drawback: their models are specialized for a single simplified degradation (\eg, bicubic degradation) and lack scalability to handle multiple degradations by using a single model. Because the practical degradation of SISR is much more complex~ _cite_, the performance of learned CNN models may deteriorate seriously when the assumed degradation deviates from the true one, making them less effective in practical scenarios. It has been pointed out that the blur kernel plays a vital role for the success of SISR methods and the mismatch of blur kernels will largely deteriorate the final SISR results~ _cite_ . However, little work has been done on how to design a CNN to address this crucial issue. Given the facts above, it is natural to raise the following questions, which are the focus of our paper: (i) Can we learn a single model to effectively handle multiple and even spatially variant degradations? (ii) Is it possible to use synthetic data to train a model with high practicability? This work aims to make one of the first attempts towards answering these two questions. To answer the first question, we revisit and analyze the general model-based SISR methods under the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Then we argue that one may tackle this issue by taking LR input, blur kernel and noise level as input to CNN but their dimensionality mismatch makes it difficult to design a single convolutional super-resolution network. In view of this, we introduce a dimensionality stretching strategy which facilitates the network to handle multiple and even spatially variant degradations with respect to blur kernel and noise. To the best of our knowledge, there is no attempt to consider both the blur kernel and noise for SISR via training a single CNN model. For the second question, we will show that it is possible to learn a practical super-resolver using synthetic data. To this end, a large variety of degradations with different combinations of blur kernels and noise levels are sampled to cover the degradation space. In a practical scenario, even the degradation is more complex (\eg, the noise is non-AWGN), we can select the best fitted degradation model rather than the bicubic degradation to produce a better result. It turns out that, by choosing a proper degradation, the learned SISR model can yield perceptually convincing results on real LR images. It should be noted that we make no effort to use specialized network architectures but use the plain CNN as in~ _cite_ . The main contributions of this paper are summarized in the following:
