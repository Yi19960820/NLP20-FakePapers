Logo recognition is the key problem in contextual ad placement, validation of product placement, and online brand management. {\em Contextual} ad placement is about placing relevant ads on webpages, images, and videos. An obvious problem in contextual advertising is "what brands appear in images and video content?" Logo recognition is the core solution to this. As absurd as it may sound, ad networks often don't know what's in the ad JPEGs that they are placing in front of web content . For example, a brand like Toyota can import an ad into Google AdWords without mentioning that "this is a Toyota ad, and we may want to place this on car-related content." We have observed that most ads contain their brand's logo, so logo recognition is the obvious solution to this. We provide a deeper explanation of these logo recognition applications in Section~ _ref_ . In this paper, we apply deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to logo recognition. We look at three problem statements in logo recognition: classification, detection without localization, and detection with localization. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by customizing DCNNs for logo recognition. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section~ _ref_, we describe related work in logo recognition methods, logo recognition applications, and object recognition. Section~ _ref_ provides an overview of publicly-available datasets of labeled logo images. In Section~ _ref_, we propose neural network architectures for logo recognition. In Section~ _ref_, we evaluate our classifiers in logo classification and detection. We conclude in Section~ _ref_ .
