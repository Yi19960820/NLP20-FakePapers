Semantic segmentation task using deep learning is formulated as a pixel-wise classification problem _cite_ . Generally, it's an encoder-decoder structure, one encoder to encode the features to lower dimensional features map and one decoder to remap the features map into several probabilistic maps (number of classes) of same width and height as input using bilinear interpolation or transposed convolutions _cite_ . End-to-end learning of the encoder-decoder model best achieved using a pre-trained classification model for the encoder on the same domain. However, for a simple problem with low spatial resolutions input size and fewer number of classes pre-trained model isn't necessary, though it helps speed up the learning process. For complex problems with many numbers of classes and higher resolutions, learning step doesn't converge to the best local optimum without a pre-trained model; leading to inferior validation mean IOU (mean pixel intersection over union) . For problems with completely unrelated domain such as medical images, satellite images etc. segmentation becomes two unrelated step; first, define and train a classification model and then use the same for the encoder to train the encoder-decoder model. How do we simplify the segmentation learning for any domains and complexity? Can we formulate the two-step processes into one step; at the same time learning both steps? We can formulate this as high-level multi-tasks learning concept to train the segmentation system. The idea of pure multi-tasks learning deviates from the main principle behind the simplification to learn one task from the feedback of another task. Here in our case segmentation is dependent on the pre-trained model, achieved using the classification step, which is completely independent of segmentation. In general, all tasks of a usual multi-tasks learning model can be learned independently; but here segmentation can't be learned independently. Another aspect of this attempt is that the classification step should be trainable on loose labels (Section~ _ref_) of the dataset. Addressing the above concerns, in this work, we define a fully end-to-end learning system, that learns classification and segmentation jointly. We will show the model performance on a diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification and features segmentation dataset. End-to-end joint segmentation and classification learning: In contrast to the existing semantic segmentation models, the proposed learning system doesn't require a pre-trained model; it learns from the feedback of the classification node. Advantages of a joint segmentation learning system? a. The scarcity of labeled segmentation data; this method can achieve better accuracy with the fewer number of segmentation ground-truths. b. Eliminating the need for pre-trained model requirements for convergence. c. Training complex model for any domains with larger input size. d. Learning a classification model as by-product alongside. Improved Residual Inception We have proposed a new improved residual inception block. Partial Attention: A partial attention mechanism to use the mid-level encoder layer features for decoder layers. Training with partial random labels: Learning method that can learn segmentation labeling while cooperatively training a classifier agent on partial random labels. In this section, we will quickly go through some of the early and recent works on semantic segmentation using deep learning. Several recent works using encoder-decoder structure focus on improving the mean IOU for semantic segmentation benchmarks such as PASACAL-VOC _cite_, MS-COCO _cite_ and biomedical image datasets. One of the first success using the convolutional net for semantic segmentation was achieved in FCN _cite_ ; where fully connected layers were replaced using unit strided convolution and upsampling layers initialized with simple bilinear interpolation were used to reconstruct the feature map. In DeconvNet _cite_, a multilayer deconvolution and unpooling network were used to predict the segmentation masks. Segnet _cite_ decoder uses encoder max-pooling indices to upsample low-resolution feature maps without learning the upsampling layers. Also, they have used convolution layer for each upsampling layer to get dense feature map. Recently, object detection and semantic segmentation were jointly learned in Mask R-CNN _cite_, they have used FCN to predict segmentation mask for each region of interest. Also several other recent methods such as PSPNet _cite_, RefineNet _cite_, ENet _cite_, Sharpmask _cite_ etc. demonstrated the advantages of encoder-decoder model using convolution and transposed convolution for the task of semantic segmentation. In general, the predicted segmentation mask is coarse and requires post-processing to remove outliers. DenseCRF _cite_ is one effective post-processing layer for semantic segmentation _cite_, it refines the segmentation masks exploiting the pixel-level pairwise closeness. For biomedical image segmentation, deep learning based approach was proposed in Unet _cite_ . For diabetic retinopathy detection and microaneurysms segmentation _cite_ using deep learning was proposed, this method adopted patch-wise classification for segmentation.
