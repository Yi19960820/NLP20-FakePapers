Humans can effortlessly and rapidly recognize surrounding objects~ _cite_, despite the tremendous variations in the projection of each object on the retina~ _cite_ caused by various transformations such as changes in object position, size, pose, illumination condition and background context~ _cite_ . This invariant recognition is presumably handled through hierarchical processing in the so-called ventral pathway. Such hierarchical processing starts in VN layers, which extract simple features such as bars and edges in different orientations~ _cite_, continues in intermediate layers such as VN and VN, which are responsive to more complex features~ _cite_, and culminates in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), where the neurons are selective to object parts or whole objects~ _cite_ . By moving from the lower layers to the higher layers, the feature complexity, receptive field size and transformation invariance increase, in such a way that the IT neurons can invariantly represent the objects in a linearly separable manner~ _cite_ . Another amazing feature of the primates' visual system is its high processing speed. The first wave of image-driven neuronal responses in IT appears around N ms after the stimulus onset~ _cite_ . Recordings from monkey IT cortex have demonstrated that the first spikes (over a short time window of N ms), about N ms after the image presentation, carry accurate information about the nature of the visual stimulus~ _cite_ . Hence, ultra-rapid object recognition is presumably performed in a feedforward manner~ _cite_ . Moreover, although there exist various intra-and inter-area feedback connections in the visual cortex, some neurophysiological~ _cite_ and theoretical~ _cite_ studies have also suggested that the feedforward information is usually sufficient for invariant object categorization. Appealed by the impressive speed and performance of the primates' visual system, computer vision scientists have long tried to ``copy'' it. So far, it is mostly the architecture of the visual system that has been mimicked. For instance, using hierarchical feedforward networks with restricted receptive fields, like in the brain, has been proven useful~ _cite_ . In comparison, the way that biological visual systems learn the appropriate features has attracted much less attention. All the above-mentioned approaches somehow use non biologically plausible learning rules. Yet the ability of the visual cortex to wire itself, mostly in an unsupervised manner, is remarkable~ _cite_ . \headheight = Npt Here, we propose that adding bio-inspired learning to bio-inspired architectures could improve the models' behavior. To this end, we focused on a particular form of synaptic plasticity known as spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which has been observed in the mamalian visual cortex~ _cite_ . Briefly, STDP reinforces the connections with afferents that significantly contributed to make a neuron fire, while it depresses the others~ _cite_ . A recent psychophysical study provided some indirect evidence for this form of plasticity in the human visual cortex~ _cite_ . In an earlier study~ _cite_, it is shown that a combination of a temporal coding scheme--where in the entry layer of a spiking neural network the most strongly activated neurons fire first--with STDP leads to a situation where neurons in higher visual areas will gradually become selective to complex visual features in an unsupervised manner. These features are both salient and consistently present in the inputs. Furthermore, as learning progresses, the neurons' responses rapidly accelerates. These responses can then be fed to a classifier to do a categorization task. In this study, we show that such an approach strongly outperforms state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms on view-invariant object recognition benchmark tasks including ND-Object~ _cite_ and ETH-N~ _cite_ datasets. These datasets contain natural and unsegmented images, where objects have large variations in scale, viewpoint, and tilt, which makes their recognition hard~ _cite_, and probably out of reach for most of the other bio-inspired models~ _cite_ . Yet our algorithm generalizes surprisingly well, even when ``simple classifiers'' are used, because STDP naturally extracts features that are class specific. This point was further confirmed using mutual information~ _cite_ and representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) ~ _cite_ . Moreover, the distribution of objects in the obtained feature space was analyzed using hierarchical clustering~ _cite_, and objects of the same category tended to cluster together.
