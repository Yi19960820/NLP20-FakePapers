X-ray computed tomography is widely used for clinical screening, diagnosis, and intervention. However, the radiation dosage associated with CT examinations may potentially induce some cancerous and genetic diseases~ _cite_ . As a result, the well-known ALARA~ _cite_ (as low as reasonably achievable) principle is universally accepted in practice, reducing unnecessary radiation exposure during medical CT imaging. One of the commonly-used methods is to lower the X-ray flux towards the x-ray detector array by adjusting the milliampere-seconds (mAs) and kVp settings for data acquisition. However, since CT imaging is a quantum integration process, an insufficient amount of photons will introduce excessive statistical noise and significantly deteriorate image quality. Therefore, how to preserve image quality for clinical tasks at minimum radiation dose has been one of the major endeavors in the CT field over the past decade. Deep learning (DL) has been now applied in almost all medical tomographic imaging areas, inspired by a large amount of image processing results~ _cite_ . In particular, several DL-based studies for image noise reduction were performed~ _cite_ . Since CNN models learn high-level representations in terms of multiple layers of feature abstraction from big training images, it is expected to have a better denoising capability than other classic image-domain methods. In this paper, we aim to maintain anatomical and pathological information, and at the same time suppress image noise due to low radiation dose. Specially, we develop a new ConvNet architecture for LDCT denoising. In order to progressively capture both local and global anatomical features, here we design cascaded subnetworks to integrate complementary textural information. Moreover, by introducing residual learning at the image reconstruction stage, the network model is made to learn the residuals between a bicubic interpolation image and the corresponding full-dose CT (FDCT) image so that the denoising performance can be boosted. Finally, with parallelized CNNs (Network in Network) local patches within the receptive field are effectively analyzed~ _cite_ . As far as the loss function is concerned, we introduce the _inline_eq_ norm instead of _inline_eq_ distance to disencourage blurring~ _cite_ .
