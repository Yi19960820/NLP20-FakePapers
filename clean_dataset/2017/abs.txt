This paper presents a novel multi-task learning-based method for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, the source and target domain classifiers are jointly learned by considering the geometry of target domain and the divergence between the source and target domains based on the concept of multi-task learning. Two novel algorithms are proposed upon the method using Regularized Least Squares and Support Vector Machines respectively. Experiments on both synthetic and real world cross domain recognition tasks have shown that the proposed methods outperform several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
