Burgeoning cancer statistics in N from World Cancer Report (WCR) estimate N million new cases of BC being registered worldwide [N] . World Health Organization (WHO) projects N, N women died from BC (which is approximately N \% of all cancer related deaths among women in N) \& impacts N million women each year [N] . Significant research spanning imaging technique like computed tomography (CT), mammography, HI anatomization \& magnetic resonance (MR) have been developed for early-stage BC prognosis through precision medicine initiative, but HI analysis is taken as the "gold standard" due to its rich encoded histological morphology \& substantiating abnormal cellular activity. Additionally, deformation dynamics of these spatial tissue textures allows more specific characterizations from a diagnostic perspective [N] \& aid pathologists to control growth \& metastasis of tumor cells \& devise therapeutic clinical schedules which are specific to particular sub-classes. However, owing to ubiquitously abundant inhomogeneous morphology \& complex intricate spatial correlations in the underlying inter-weaved biological tissue fabric of biopsy samples [N], automated machine vision for robust \& accurate multi-class BC detection is still a challenging task \& eludes researchers. Manual BC multi-classification by the pathologist is arduous \& requires domain expertise with interpretations being subjective in nature. An automated computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system overcome these challenges \& assist clinicians in reliable diagnosis by reducing their workload \& avoid erroneous diagnosis [N-N] . Further, practical CAD systems face challenges of inefficient hand-crafted feature engineering, which is computationally intensive \& time consuming. Secondly, optimal supervised feature selection for accurate BC identification via image segmentation \& identification of primitives like nuclei deformation, tubule formation, lymphocytes presence etc., [N] \& high-resolution HI analysis is computationally expensive requiring costly high-performance computation, which is generally not available in developing countries. Subtle inter-class \& intra-class variability w.r.t., contrast \& textures are evident in fig. N. Fig. N shows representative Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H \&E) stained fine-grained multi-class biopsy tissue slides. (Taken from BreaKHis @ _inline_eq_ magnification [N]) . To resolve these challenges, a reliable \& more accurate practical method for BC multi-classification via DNN is developed. The proposed method discards feature engineering \& employs end-to-end training of deep discriminative ensemble of holistic CSML of HI \& local high-level to low-level semantic hierarchical hash signatures followed by softmax layer for classification. The model is validated with N HI's to demonstrate its potency for deployment in clinical settings on generic processors \& experimental result shows superior performance.
