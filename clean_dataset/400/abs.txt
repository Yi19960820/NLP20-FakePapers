In recent years, there has been renewed interest in developing methods for skeleton-based human action recognition. A skeleton sequence can be naturally represented as a high-order tensor time series. In this paper, we model and analyze tensor time series with Linear Dynamical System (LDS) which is the most common for encoding spatio-temporal time-series data in various disciplines dut to its relative simplicity and efficiency. However, the traditional LDS treats the latent and observation state at each frame of video as a column vector. Such a vector representation fails to take into account the curse of dimensionality as well as valuable structural information with human action. Considering this fact, we propose generalized Linear Dynamical System (gLDS) for modeling tensor observation in the time series and employ Tucker decomposition to estimate the LDS parameters as action descriptors. Therefore, an action can be represented as a subspace corresponding to a point on a Grassmann manifold. Then we perform classification using dictionary learning and sparse coding over Grassmann manifold. Experiments on MSR ActionND Dataset, UCF Kinect Dataset and Northwestern-UCLA Multiview ActionND Dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
