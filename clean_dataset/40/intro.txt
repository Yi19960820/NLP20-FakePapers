A ground penetrating radar (GPR, hereafter) is used for probing the underground by transmitting radio waves from an antenna held closely to the surface and acquiring the echoes reflected from subsurface anomalies or buried objects. As the electromagnetic wave travels through the subsurface, its velocity changes due to the physical properties of the materials in the medium. By recording such changes in the velocity and measuring the travel time of the radar signals, a GPR generates profiles of scattering responses from the subsurface. The interest in GPR is due to its ability to reveal buried objects non-invasively and detect non-metallic scatterers with increased sensitivity to dielectric contrast _cite_ . From the recordings of the previously observed regions, GPR surveys can also extrapolate subsurface knowledge for inaccessible or unexcavated areas. This sensing technique is, therefore, attractive for several applications such as geophysics, archeology, forensics, and defense (see e.g. _cite_ for some surveys) . Over the last decade, there has been a spurt in GPR research because of advances in electronics and computing resources. GPR has now surpassed traditional ground applications and has become a more general ultra-wideband remote sensing system with proliferation to novel avenues such as through-the-wall imaging, building construction, food safety monitoring, and vegetation observation. In this work, we consider the application of detecting buried landmines using GPR. This is one of the most extensively investigated GPR applications due to its obvious security and humanitarian importance _cite_ . Mine detection GPR usually operates in the L-band (_inline_eq_-_inline_eq_ GHz) with ultra-wideband (UWB) transmission in order to achieve both sufficient resolution to detect small targets (_inline_eq_-_inline_eq_ cm diameter) and penetrate solid media at shallow depths (_inline_eq_-_inline_eq_ cm) _cite_ . Even though a lot of progress has been made on GPR for landmine detection, discriminating them from natural and manmade clutter remains a critical challenge. In such applications, the signal distortion due to inhomogeneous soil clutter, surface roughness and antenna ringing hampers target recognition. Moreover, the constituting material of many models of landmines is largely plastic and has a very weak response to radar signals due to its low dielectric contrast with respect to the soil _cite_ . Finally, a major problem arises due to low radar cross section (RCS) of some landmine models _cite_ . A variety of signal processing algorithms have been proposed for detection of low metal-content landmines in realistic scenarios; approaches based on feature extraction and classification are found to be the most successful (see e.g. _cite_), yet false-alarm rates remain very high. Sparse representation (SR) is effective in extracting the mid-or high-level features in image classification _cite_ . In the context of anti-personnel landmines recognition using GPR, our prior work _cite_ has shown that frameworks based on SR improve the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in distinguishing different types of mines and clutter in highly corrupted GPR signals. In this approach, the signal-of-interest is transformed into a domain where it can be expressed as a linear combination of only a few atoms chosen from a collection called the dictionary matrix _cite_ . The dictionary may be learned from the data it is going to represent. Dictionary learning (DL) techniques (or sparse coding in machine learning parlance) aim to create adaptive dictionaries which provide the sparsest reconstruction for given training-sets, i.e., a representation with a minimum number of constituting atoms. DL methods are critical building blocks in many applications such as deep learning, image denoising, and super-resolution; see _cite_ for further applications. Classical DL algorithms such as Method of Optimal Directions (MOD) _cite_ and K-SVD _cite_ operate in batches-dealing with the entire training set in each iteration. Although extremely successful, these methods are computationally demanding and not scalable to high-dimensional training sets. An efficient alternative is the Online Dictionary Learning (ODL) algorithm _cite_ that has faster convergence than batch DL methods. In this work, we develop a new approach toward classification based on online DL-SR framework for the specific case of GPR-based landmine identification. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: N) Faster DL for GPR landmine classification. We investigate the application of DL towards GPR-based landmine classification. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been investigated previously. Furthermore, online DL methods have been studied more generally in GPR. Only one other previous study has employed DL (K-SVD) using GPR signals _cite_, although for the application of identifying bedrock features. We employ online DL methods and use the coefficients of the resulting sparse vectors as input to a SVM classifier to distinguish mines from clutter. Our comparison of K-SVD and online DL using real data from L-band GPR shows that online DL algorithms present distinct advantages in speed and low false-alarm rates. We propose a new Drop-Off MINi-batch Online Dictionary Learning (DOMINODL) which processes the training data in mini-batches and avoids unnecessary update of the irrelevant atoms in order to reduce the computational complexity. The intuition for the dropoff step comes from the fact that some training samples are highly correlated and, therefore, in the interest of processing time, they can be dropped during training without significantly affecting performance. N) Better statistical metrics for improved classification. Contrary to previous studies _cite_ which determine DL parameters (number of iterations, atoms, etc.) based on bulk statistics such as normalized root-mean-square-error (NRMSE), we consider statistical inference for parameter analysis. Our methods based on Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test distance _cite_ and Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) Inequality _cite_ are able to fine-tune model selection resulting in improved mine classification performance. N) Experimental validation for different landmine sizes. Our comparison of K-SVD with three online DL algorithms-ODL, its correlation-based variant _cite_ and DOMINODL-shows that online methods successfully detect mines with very small RCS buried deep into clutter and noise. Some recent studies _cite_ employ state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify GPR-based mines data. Our comparison with CNN illustrates that it has poorer performance in detection of small mines than our online DL approaches. This may also be caused by the relatively small dimensions of our training set which, even if perfectly adequate for DL, may not meet the expected requirements for CNN _cite_ . We also show that the classification performance of online DL methods does not deteriorate significantly when signal samples are reduced. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we formally describe the classification problem and GPR specific challenges. In Section~ _ref_, we explain various DL algorithms used in our methodology and also describe DOMINODL. We provide an overview of the GPR system and field campaign to collect GPR data sets in Section~ _ref_ . In Section~ _ref_, we introduce our techniques for DL parameter selection. Section~ _ref_ presents classification and reconstruction results using real radar data. We conclude in Section~ _ref_ . Throughout this paper, we reserve boldface lowercase and uppercase letters for vectors and matrices, respectively. The _inline_eq_ th element of a vector _inline_eq_ is _inline_eq_ while the _inline_eq_ th entry of the matrix _inline_eq_ is _inline_eq_ . We denote the transpose by _inline_eq_ . We represent the set of real and complex numbers by _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_, respectively. Other sets are represented by calligraphic letters. The notation _inline_eq_ stands for the _inline_eq_-norm of its argument and _inline_eq_ is the Frobenius norm. A subscript in the parenthesis such as _inline_eq_ is the value of the argument in the _inline_eq_ th iteration. The convolution product is denoted by _inline_eq_ . The function _inline_eq_ outputs a diagonal matrix with the input vector along its main diagonal. We use _inline_eq_ to denote probability, _inline_eq_ is the statistical expectation, and _inline_eq_ denotes the absolute value. The functions _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ output the maximum and supremum value of their arguments, respectively.
