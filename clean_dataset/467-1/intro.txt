In the last years, the analysis of the human behavior has been of high interest to researchers because its important and different applications, such as: video surveillance _cite_, ambient assisted living _cite_, analysis of consumer's behavior _cite_, group interactions and many others. In particular, in the field of intelligent retail environments, numerous studies to investigate how shoppers behave inside a store and how businesses can change strategies to improve sales are emerging. In order to analyse the buyer activity and to solve general aspects of these problems, techniques of artificial intelligence are used and, in particular, vision and image processing. In recent years, the visual analysis of dynamic scenes is one of the most important research activities in computer vision and image understanding~ _cite_ . When the visual analysis concerns moving scenes, the general method includes following steps: modelling of environments, motion detection, human identification, classification of moving objects, tracking, behavior understanding and data fusion from multiple cameras _cite_ . In this manuscript, we focus the attention on the study of the consumer behavior in a real retail store, in order to recognize human actions _cite_, such as ``interacting with the shelf'', ``picking or releasing a product'', ``moving in a group'', and ``knowing most visited areas in the store''. Consumers are main actors in the project because the goal is to increase their satisfaction and, therefore, enhance their purchases. Currently, the identification of the shoppers' behavior implements systems of human observation or video recording with traditional cameras. Some tools, such as virtual stores or eye tracking provide incomplete and unrepresentative data because they are based on a small sample of buyers. As a result, by univocally identifying shoppers and automatically analysing their interactions with the products on the shelves and their activities in different zones, our design considerably increases the value of the current marketing research methodologies. Moreover, the main innovation concerns the original use of tracking system, and the other interesting point concerns the real experimental platform described in the results section combined with a vision based statistical approach. Therefore, the project aims to propose an intelligent low-cost embedded system able to univocally identify customers, to analyse behaviors and interactions of shoppers and to provide a large amount of data on which to perform statistics. The automatic extraction of features that univocally recognize each subject in the scene and their movements, provides an important tool to identify important operations concerning marketing strategies. The application implements techniques of image processing such as: background subtraction, low-level segmentation, tracking and finding contours, in order to map a single shopper and/or a group of people within the store that interact with the products on the shelves, defining an ID unique to each visitor filmed by the camera, and classifying these interactions. Paper is organized as following described: Section~ _ref_ introduces the main aspects of marketing retail and consumer behavior. Section~ _ref_ in detail describes the architecture of the system. The experimental setup is described in Section~ _ref_ and the results are showed in Section~ _ref_ . Last Section~ _ref_ described conclusions and future works.
