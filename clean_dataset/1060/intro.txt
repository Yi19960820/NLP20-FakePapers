brain segmentation, or brain extraction, is one of the first fundamental steps in the analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI) in advanced neuroimaging applications such as brain tissue segmentation and volumetric analysis _cite_, longitudinal and group analysis _cite_, cortical and sub-cortical surface analysis and thickness measurement~ _cite_, and surgical planning. Manual brain extraction is time consuming especially in large-scale studies. Automated brain extraction is necessary but its performance and accuracy are critical as the output of this step can directly affect the performance of all following steps. Recently neural networks and deep learning have attracted enormous attention in medical image processing. Brebisson et.al.~ _cite_ proposed the SegNet, a convolutional neural network system to segment different parts of the brain. Recently, CNN-based methods have also been used successfully in tumor segmentation~ _cite_, brain lesion segmentation~ _cite_, and infant brain image segmentation~ _cite_ . In what follows we review the state-of-the-art in whole brain segmentation and the related work that motivated this study. We then introduce a CNN-based method that generates accurate brain extraction.
