There has been a growing interest in age estimation from facial images, driven by the increasing demands for a variety of potential applications in forensic research~ _cite_, security control~ _cite_, human-computer interaction (HCI) ~ _cite_ and social media~ _cite_ . Although this problem has been extensively studied, the ability to automatically estimate ages accurately and reliably from facial images is still far from meeting human performance. There are two kinds of age estimation tasks. One is real age estimation, which is to estimate the precise biological (chronological) age of a person from his or her facial image; the other is age group estimation~ _cite_, which is to predict whether a person's age falls within some range rather than predicting the real chronological age. In this paper, we focus on the first task, i.e., precise age regression. To address this problem, the key is to learn a nonlinear mapping function between facial image features and the real chronological age. However, to learn such a mapping is challenging. The main difficulty is the facial feature space w.r.t ages is heterogeneous, due to two facts: N) there is a large variation in facial appearance across different persons of the same age (Fig.~ _ref_ (a)) ; N) the human face matures in different ways at different ages, e.g., bone growth in childhood and skin wrinkles in adulthood~ _cite_ (Fig.~ _ref_ (b)) . To model such heterogeneous data, existing age estimation methods either find a kernel-based global non-linear mapping~ _cite_, or apply divide-and-conquer strategies to partition the data space and learn multiple local regressors~ _cite_ . However, each of them has drawbacks: Learning non-stationary kernels is inevitably biased by the heterogeneous data distribution and thus easily causes over-fitting~ _cite_ ; Divide-and-conquer is a good strategy to learn the non-stationary age changes in human faces, but the existing methods make hard partitions according to ages~ _cite_ . Consequently, they may not find homogeneous subsets for learning local regressors~ _cite_ . To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose differentiable regression forests for age estimation. Random forests or randomized decision trees~ _cite_, are a popular ensemble predictive model, in which each tree structure naturally performs data partition at split nodes and data abstraction at leaf nodes~ _cite_ . Traditional regression forests make hard data partitions, based on heuristics such as using a greedy algorithm where locally-optimal hard decisions are made at each split node~ _cite_ . Unlike them, the proposed differentiable regression forests perform soft data partition, so that an input-dependent partition function can be learned to handle heterogeneous data. In addition, the input feature space and the data abstractions at leaf nodes (local regressors) can be learned jointly, which ensures that the local input-output correlation is homogeneous at the leaf node. Recently, end-to-end learning with CNN has become very popular and has been shown to be useful for improving the performance of various computer vision tasks, such as image classification~ _cite_, semantic segmentation~ _cite_ and object detection~ _cite_ . Our differentiable regression forests can be seamlessly integrated with any deep networks, which enables us to conduct an end-to-end deep age estimation model, which we name Deep Regression Forests (DRFs) . To build such a tree based model, we apply an alternating optimization strategy: first we fix the leaf nodes and optimize the data partitions at split nodes as well as the CNN parameters (feature learning) by Back-propagation; Then, we fix the split nodes and optimize the data abstractions at leaf nodes (local regressors) by Variational Bounding~ _cite_ . These two learning steps are alternatively performed to jointly optimize feature learning and regression modeling for age estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on three standard benchmarks for real age estimation methods: MORPH~ _cite_, FG-NET~ _cite_ and the Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) ~ _cite_ . Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on these three benchmarks. Our algorithm was inspired by Deep Neural Decision Forests (dNDFs) ~ _cite_ and Label Distribution Learning Forests (LDLFs) ~ _cite_, but differs in its objective (regression classification/label distribution learning) . Extending differentiable decision trees to deal with regression is non-trivial, as the distribution of the output space for regression is continuous, but the distribution of the output space for the two classification tasks is discrete. The contribution of this paper is three folds: N) We propose Deep Regression Forests (DRFs), an end-to-end model, to deal with heterogeneous data by jointly learning input-dependant data partition at split nodes and data abstraction at leaf nodes. N) Based on Variational Bounding, the convergence of our update rule for leaf nodes in DRFs is mathematically guaranteed. N) We apply DRFs on three standard age estimation benchmarks, and achieve state-of-the-art results.
