Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are higher for idling over N seconds, compared to restarting~ _cite_ . Idling for N minutes a day costs the drivers a total of _inline_eq_ billion dollars a year in the USA~ _cite_ . Increased exhaust emission is another unpleasant consequence of idling. The Paris Climate Agreement~ _cite_, adopted in N, aims to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduce global warming and air pollution. Reducing vehicular emission is important to contribute to the agreement. One way to reduce vehicular emission is to reduce idling time. In line with this, in Singapore, it is prohibited to keep a vehicle idling for more than _inline_eq_ minutes, for reasons other than traffic conditions. Currently, this regulation is enforced by human officers by manually checking if a parked vehicle is idling or not. It is desirable to employ an automatic system for monitoring, since manual checking is not practical. Moreover, the automatic system can also archive evidence of the infringement. Motivated by this, we propose the first automated system to detect idling cars by monitoring the car temperature with the help of a thermal infrared (IR) camera. The intuition is that there should be differences between the spatio-temporal heat signatures of idling and stopped cars. In an idling car, the engine is running, producing and dissipating heat; the fan cooling is active to keep the engine temperature at a specific level; the air conditioning may be active to regulate the internal car temperature. When the engine is turned off, the heat inside the engine starts to dissipate out, first heating up the car for some time, and then cooling down; the cooling system and air conditioning are inactive. These all contribute to the spatio-temporal heat signature of a car, which can be monitored remotely with an IR camera. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work that can remotely detect idling cars, using thermal infrared cameras or other sensors. This work is the first to collect a dataset and propose an automated remote idling car detection system using an IR camera. This paper is an extended version of _cite_, which presents an idling car detection framework using convolutional neural networks. This paper additionally includes (i) evaluation of temporal modeling approaches for idling detection, (ii) evaluation of spatio-temporal modeling for idling detection using convolutional and recurrent networks, (iii) more detailed description and analysis of the IR car image sequence dataset, and (iv) more detailed description and analysis of car detection and idling classification using convolutional neural networks. Thermal infrared cameras are passive sensors that capture the infrared radiation emitted by objects and form an image in which the intensities correspond to temperature values~ _cite_ . They operate in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. They were originally designed for military applications~ _cite_, surveillance and night vision. Currently, they are being used for more diverse applications, such as gas leakage detection, building heat loss inspection, object detection~ _cite_, pedestrian detection~ _cite_, face detection and recognition~ _cite_, and health applications~ _cite_ owing to their falling prices. They are still expensive compared to RGB cameras. IR cameras measure the surface temperature of the objects, which depends on the emissivity of the surfaces, which in turn depends on the viewing angle~ _cite_ . Contrary to common misconception, thermal infrared cameras cannot see through walls, objects, or even glass. In our case, we can only observe the surface temperature of a car, and not the actual temperature inside the engine. The temperature inside the engine is around _inline_eq_ C, while the operating temperature of a car (coolant temperature) is around _inline_eq_ C; the surface temperature outside the car (the measured temperature) is below this value. The exhaust temperature can be slightly higher than the operating temperature. We propose the framework shown in Figure~ _ref_ to detect idling cars. First, we use an IR camera to obtain IR image sequences, hence the temperature, of the whole car park. Then, we apply car detection on each IR image in the sequence to localize the cars and then, further track them to identify stationary/parked cars. Finally, we classify the detected stationary cars as idling or not. We experimented with two different approaches for classification: (N) Using the temporal evolution of maximum car temperature sequence as an input feature to a classifier (Section~ _ref_) . (N) Modeling the spatio-temporal change of car temperature with convolutional and recurrent neural networks that learn the useful features automatically from the data (Section~ _ref_) .
