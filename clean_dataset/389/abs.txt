Unsupervised domain mapping aims to learn a function to translate domain _inline_eq_ to _inline_eq_ by a function _inline_eq_ in the absence of paired examples. Finding the optimal _inline_eq_ without paired data is an ill-posed problem, so appropriate constraints are required to obtain reasonable solutions. One of the most prominent constraints is cycle consistency, which enforces the translated image by _inline_eq_ to be translated back to the input image by an inverse mapping _inline_eq_ . While cycle consistency requires the simultaneous training of _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_, recent studies have shown that one-sided domain mapping can be achieved by preserving pairwise distances between images. Although cycle consistency and distance preservation successfully constrain the solution space, they overlook the special properties of images that simple geometric transformations do not change the image's semantic structure. Based on this special property, we develop a geometry-consistent generative adversarial network (GcGAN), which enables one-sided unsupervised domain mapping. GcGAN takes the original image and its counterpart image transformed by a predefined geometric transformation as inputs and generates two images in the new domain coupled with the corresponding geometry-consistency constraint. The geometry-consistency constraint reduces the space of possible solutions while keep the correct solutions in the search space. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with the baseline (GAN alone) and the state-of-the-art methods including CycleGAN _cite_ and DistanceGAN _cite_ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
