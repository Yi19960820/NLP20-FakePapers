Since its invention in the Nineteenth Century photography has been used for multiple science purposes including astronomy, medicine and biology. To observe wild animals without disturbing them was an early goal of photography, but it was not until N when George Shiras developed a method using a tripwire and a flash system allowing that wild animals be auto-photographed~ _cite_ . Shiras' method was the beginning of camera trapping development that evolved to more complex systems and that nowadays uses infrared beams as a triggering device. They are small, portable, digital, and resistant to the most challenging ecosystem conditions for weeks, yet months. Currently, automated camera-traps used in wildlife studies are small boxes, grabbed to a tree, rock or other structure. Camera-traps are powerful tools for wildlife scientists who, thanks to this method, can answer questions such as ``Which animal species occurs in a certain area?'', ``What are they doing?'', ``How many are there?'', among others. Also fundamental studies, like detecting rare species, delineating speciesâ€™ distributions, documenting predation, monitoring animal behavior, and other vital rates~ _cite_ are carried out with this method. Hence, it allows biologist to protect animals and its environment from extinction or man-made damage. Although camera trapping is a useful methodology in ecology this method generates a large volume of images. Therefore it is a big challenge to process the recorded images and even harder, if the biologists are looking to identify all photographed species. Currently, no automatic approach is used to identify species from camera-trap images. Researchers analyze thousands or millions of photographs manually~ _cite_ . An automatic system that deals with this problem would accelerate the professionals' work, allowing them to focus on data analysis and important issues only. Automatic classification of animal species in camera-trap images still remains an unsolved problem due to very challenging image conditions. A few previous works proposed solutions for this problem. Yu et.al~ _cite_ manually cropped and selected images, which contain the whole animal body. This conditioning allowed then to obtain _inline_eq_ of accuracy classifying _inline_eq_ animal species in their own dataset. Chen et.al~ _cite_ use an automatic segmentation algorithm but they obtained only _inline_eq_ of accuracy. Before the releasing of the Snapshot Serengeti dataset~ _cite_ there was no publicly available dataset to work with and for benchmarking. This dataset was released in N to allow the computer science community to study and overcome the challenges present in camera trapping framework. In this work very deep convolutional neural networks are proposed in order to solve the species identification task over the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Versions of unbalanced, balanced, conditioned, and segmented dataset are used in order to study if a powerful learning algorithm can overcome the four common issues in camera trapping: unbalanced samples, empty frames, incomplete animal images, and objects too far from focal distance. Our results show that with enough data, conditions and learning capacity, the camera trapping species recognition task can be fully automated. The model also outperforms previous approximations and shows how robust learning algorithms are to corrupted data produced by wrong annotations from citizens. In addition all datasets derived from Snapshot Serengeti (including manually segmented images) and the trained models, are publicly available.
