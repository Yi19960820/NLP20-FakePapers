Motion blur is one of the most commonly arising types of artifacts when taking photos. Shakes of camera and fast object motions degrade image quality to undesired blurry images. Furthermore, various causes such as depth variation, occlusion in motion boundaries make blurs even more complex. Single image deblurring problem is to estimate the unknown sharp image given a blurry image. Earlier studies focused on removing blurs caused by simple translational or rotational camera motions. More recent works try to handle general non-uniform blurs caused by depth variation, camera shakes and object motions in dynamic environments. Most of these approaches are based on following blur model ~ _cite_ . where B, S and n are vectorized blurry image, latent sharp image, and noise, respectively. K is a large sparse matrix whose rows each contain a local blur kernel acting on S to generate a blurry pixel. In practice, blur kernel is unknown. Thus, blind deblurring methods try to estimate latent sharp image _inline_eq_ and blur kernel _inline_eq_ simultaneously. Finding blur kernel for every pixel is a severely ill-posed problem. Thus, some approaches tried to parametrize blur models with simple assumptions on the sources of blurs. In ~ _cite_, they assumed that blur is caused by ND camera motion only. However, in dynamic scenes, the kernel estimation is more challenging as there are multiple moving objects as well as camera motion. Thus, Kim et al.~ _cite_ proposed a dynamic scene deblurring method that jointly segments and deblurs a non-uniformly blurred image, allowing the estimation of complex (non-linear) kernel within a segment. In addition, Kim and Lee~ _cite_ approximated the blur kernel to be locally linear and proposed an approach that estimates both the latent image and the locally linear motions jointly. However, these blur kernel approximations are still inaccurate, especially in the cases of abrupt motion discontinuities and occlusions. Note that such erroneous kernel estimation directly affects the quality of the latent image, resulting in undesired ringing artifacts. Recently, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have been applied in numerous computer vision problems including deblurring problem and showed promising results ~ _cite_ . Since no pairs of real blurry image and ground truth sharp image are available for supervised learning, they commonly used blurry images generated by convolving synthetic blur kernels. In ~ _cite_, synthesized blur images with uniform blur kernel are used for training. And, in ~ _cite_, classification CNN is trained to estimate locally linear blur kernels. Thus, CNN-based models are still suited only to some specific types of blurs, and there are restrictions on more common spatially varying blurs. Therefore, all the existing methods still have many problems before they could be generalized and used in practice. These are mainly due to the use of simple and unrealistic blur kernel models. Thus, to solve those problems, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for dynamic scene deblurring. First, we propose a multi-scale CNN that directly restores latent images without assuming any restricted blur kernel model. Especially, the multi-scale architecture is designed to mimic conventional coarse-to-fine optimization methods. Unlike other approaches, our method does not estimate explicit blur kernels. Accordingly, our method is free from artifacts that arise from kernel estimation errors. Second, we train the proposed model with a multi-scale loss that is appropriate for coarse-to-fine architecture that enhances convergence greatly. In addition, we further improve the results by employing adversarial loss~ _cite_ . Third, we propose a new realistic blurry image dataset with ground truth sharp images. To obtain kernel model-free dataset for training, we employ the dataset acquisition method introduced in~ _cite_ . As the blurring process can be modeled by the integration of sharp images during shutter time~ _cite_, we captured a sequence of sharp frames of a dynamic scene with a high-speed camera and averaged them to generate a blurry image by considering gamma correction. By training with the proposed dataset and adding proper augmentation, our model can handle general local blur kernel implicitly. As the loss term optimizes the result to resemble the ground truth, it even restores occluded regions where blur kernel is extremely complex as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . We trained our model with millions of pairs of image patches and achieved significant improvements in dynamic scene deblurring. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is far superior to those of the state-of-the-art dynamic scene deblurring methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. There are several approaches that employed CNNs for deblurring~ _cite_ . Xu et al.~ _cite_ proposed an image deconvolution CNN to deblur a blurry image in a non-blind setting. They built a network based on the separable kernel property that the (inverse) blur kernel can be decomposed into a small number of significant filters. Additionally, they incorporated the denoising network~ _cite_ to reduce visual artifacts such as noise and color saturation by concatenating the module at the end of their proposed network. On the other hand, Schuler et al.~ _cite_ proposed a blind deblurring method with CNN. Their proposed network mimics conventional optimization-based deblurring methods and iterates the feature extraction, kernel estimation, and the latent image estimation steps in a coarse-to-fine manner. To obtain pairs of sharp and blurry images for network training, they generated uniform blur kernels using a Gaussian process and synthesized lots of blurry images by convolving them to the sharp images collected from the ImageNet dataset~ _cite_ . However, they reported performance limits for large blurs due to their suboptimal architecture. Similarly to the work of Couzinie-Devy et al.~ _cite_, Sun et al.~ _cite_ proposed a sequential deblurring approach. First, they generated pairs of blurry and sharp patches with N candidate blur kernels. Next, they trained classification CNN to measure the likelihood of a specific blur kernel of a local patch. And then smoothly varying blur kernel is obtained by optimizing an energy model that is composed of the CNN likelihoods and smoothness priors. Final latent image estimation is performed with conventional optimization method~ _cite_ . Note that all these methods require an accurate kernel estimation step for restoring the latent sharp image. In contrast, our proposed model is learned to produce the latent image directly without estimating blur kernels. In other computer vision tasks, several forms of coarse-to-fine architecture or multi-scale architecture were applied~ _cite_ . However, not all multi-scale CNNs are designed to produce optimal results, similarly to ~ _cite_ . In depth estimation, optical flow estimation, etc., networks usually produce outputs having smaller resolution compared to input image resolution~ _cite_ . These methods have difficulties in handling long-range dependency even if multi-scale architecture is used. Therefore, we make a multi-scale architecture that preserves fine-grained detail information as well as long-range dependency from coarser scales. Furthermore, we make sure intermediate level networks help the final stage in an explicit way by training network with multi-scale losses. Conventionally, it was essential to find blur kernel before estimating latent image. CNN based methods were no exception~ _cite_ . However, estimating kernel involves several problems. First, assuming simple kernel convolution cannot model several challenging cases such as occluded regions or depth variations. Second, kernel estimation process is subtle and sensitive to noise and saturation, unless blur model is carefully designed. Furthermore, incorrectly estimated kernels give rise to artifacts in latent images. Third, finding spatially varying kernel for every pixel in dynamic scene requires a huge amount of memory and computation. Therefore, we adopt kernel-free methods in both blur dataset generation and latent image estimation. In blurry image generation, we follow to approximate camera imaging process, rather than assuming specific motions, instead of finding or designing complex blur kernel. We capture successive sharp frames and integrate to simulate blurring process. The detailed procedure is described in section ~ _ref_ . Note that our dataset is composed of blurry and sharp image pairs only, and that the local kernel information is implicitly embedded in it. In Fig.~ _ref_, our kernel-free blurry image is compared with a conventional synthesized image with uniform blur kernel. Notably, the blur image generated by our method exhibits realistic and spatially varying blurs caused by the moving person and the static background, while the blur image synthesized by conventional method does not. For latent image estimation, we do not assume blur sources and train the model solely on our blurry and sharp image pairs. Thus, our proposed method does not suffer from kernel-related problems in deblurring.
