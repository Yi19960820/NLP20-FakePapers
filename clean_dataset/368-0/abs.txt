To simplify the parameter of the deep learning network, a cascaded compressive sensing model ``CSNet'' is implemented for image classification. Firstly, we use cascaded compressive sensing network to learn feature from the data. Secondly, CSNet generates the feature by binary hashing and block-wise histograms. Finally, a linear SVM classifier is used to classify these features. The experiments on the MNIST dataset indicate that higher classification accuracy can be obtained by this algorithm.
