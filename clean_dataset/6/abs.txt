Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are the most recent exciting advancement in deep learning field and their applications are quickly spreading in multi-cross-domains including bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social networks, natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we expose and tackle some of the basic weaknesses of a GCNN model with a capsule idea presented in~ _cite_ and propose our Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN) model. In addition, we design our GCAPS-CNN model to solve especially graph classification problem which current GCNN models find challenging. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed Graph Capsule Network can significantly outperforms both the existing state-of-art deep learning methods and graph kernels on graph classification benchmark datasets.
