Automated lesion detection in computed tomography (CT) scans plays an important role in computer-aided disease screening and tracking. To differentiate lesions from non-lesions, ND context is crucial _cite_ . However, existing detection frameworks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) _cite_ are typically designed for ND images. Therefore, algorithms that can take ND context information into consideration are in need. As a direct solution, Liao et al. cite {LiaoNLungNd} extended the region proposal network (RPN) _cite_ to ND RPN to process volumetric CT data. However, ND CNNs are very memory-consuming so that sometimes it is hard to fit a single sample into the memory of a mainstream GPU _cite_ . To solve this problem, _cite_ used small ND patches as the input of the network. Besides, ND bounding-boxes are generally more difficult to annotate than ND ones, which leads to sparse training data for ND RPNs. Hence, data augmentation was used in _cite_ to combat over-fitting. In _cite_, ND networks were first applied to generate lesion candidates, then ND CNN classifiers were trained for false positive reduction (FPR) . Some researchers trained classifiers on the aggregation of multiple ND slices (e.g. \, three orthogonal views (N) or random views of the candidate lesion) for FPR _cite_ . FPR-based approaches have two stages and are not end-to-end. In this paper, we propose ND context enhanced region-based CNNs (NDCE) to incorporate ND context into ND regional CNNs. Multiple neighboring slices are sent into a ND detection network to generate feature maps separately, which are then aggregated for final prediction. We improve the region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) _cite_ for this task. NDCE has many advantages: N) Compared with the N-stage candidate generation + FPR approaches, NDCE is more efficient and end-to-end in both training and inference. N) It can leverage popular ND CNN backbones and pretrained weights such as VGG-N _cite_ . The weights are learned from millions of images _cite_ and are known to be beneficial for transfer learning _cite_ . On the contrary, ND CNNs lack such pretrained models and have to be trained from scratch. N) NDCE only requires ND bounding-box annotations to train. Compared with ND methods, it can obtain large-scale training data more easily, e.g., from radiologists' routine lesion measurements _cite_ . Previous studies on lesion detection generally focused on specific types of lesions, such as lung nodules and liver lesions. While some common types receive much attention, many infrequent but still clinically significant types have been ignored. In this paper, we apply the proposed algorithm on DeepLesion _cite_, a large-scale and diverse lesion dataset. It contains over NK ND annotations of lesions with a variety of types. Using this dataset, we develop a universal lesion detection algorithm that finds all types of lesions with one unified framework. After incorporating ND contexts with NDCE, the sensitivity of lesion detection with N false positives per image is improved from N \% to N \% on the test set of the challenging dataset, proving the effectiveness of NDCE.
