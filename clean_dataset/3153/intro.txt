Deep learning methods have been successful for a variety of medical image-based learning problems, such as segmentation or disease classification _cite_ . Due to time-consuming annotation, e.g., by a trained expert, medical datasets are often small compared to typical datasets in the natural image domain _cite_ . Often, medical datasets are heterogeneous due to differences between patients which makes generalization to new patients challenging. Variations in data acquisition can complicate this even further. As these variations are independent of the underlying disease, a deep learning model should learn invariance towards these properties, given a large enough dataset. However, for small datasets, a model might quickly overfit to patient-or acquisition-specific features, which requires additional regularization or data augmentation. This problem is present in particular for intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) imaging. The technique is used for imaging the inside of coronary arterial walls in order to identify plaque deposits that might lead to atherosclerosis. Deep learning-based plaque classification methods have been proposed, however, their performance is limited _cite_ . Thus, data augmentation and transfer learning have been used for IVOCT-based classification _cite_ which significantly improved performance. We propose a new regularization method that enforces patient-independent feature learning for small medical datasets. The adversarial training strategy is inspired by domain adversarial training _cite_ . We adopt the proposed structure and use it for a very different purpose. We show its effectiveness compared to standard data augmentation methods on a small dataset for IVOCT-based plaque classification.
