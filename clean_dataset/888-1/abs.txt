Generally, facial age variations affect gender classification accuracy significantly, because facial shape and skin texture change as they grow old.~This requires re-examination on the gender classification system to consider facial age information.~In this paper, we propose Multi-expert Gender Classification on Age Group (MGA), an end-to-end multi-task learning schemes of age estimation and gender classification.~First, two types of deep neural networks are utilized; Convolutional Appearance Network (CAN) for facial appearance feature and Deep Geometry Network (DGN) for facial geometric feature.~Then, CAN and DGN are integrated by the proposed model integration strategy and fine-tuned in order to improve age and gender classification accuracy.~The facial images are categorized into one of three age groups (young, adult and elder group) based on their estimated age, and the system makes a gender decision according to average fusion strategy of three gender classification experts, which are trained to fit gender characteristics of each age group.~Rigorous experimental results conducted on the challenging databases suggest that the proposed MGA outperforms several prior arts with smaller computational cost.
