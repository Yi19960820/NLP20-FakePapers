order to distinguish melanoma from benign lesions, dermatologists often rely on using melanoma-specific image cues to aid in their diagnosis. Dermoscopy images, which are captured with a dermatoscope, offer a magnified view of the skin lesion and allow dermatologists to visualize structures within the lesion that may indicate melanoma~ _cite_ . For example, the N-point checklist~ _cite_ is a scoring system that checks for the presence of visual cues (\eg streaks) in dermoscopy images, and assigns a numerical score that, if exceeded, may indicate melanoma. This helps give dermatologists an objective criteria on which to base their diagnosis. \subsubsection* {Detecting Dermoscopic Features} Many groups have studied how to detect and classify clinical dermoscopic features from dermoscopy. Celebi~ \etal~ _cite_ detected the blue-whitish veil in dermoscopy images. They formed a feature vector using colour and texture based features from patches of pixels, and used a decision tree to classify the patch. Sadeghi \etal~ _cite_ proposed geometric, structural, orientation, and chromatic features to capture the properties of streaks. Combined with colour and texture based features, they classified absent, regular, and irregular streaks. Mirzaalian~ \etal~ _cite_ modeled the tubular properties of streaks with a Hessian based tubular filter. They computed a feature vector by measuring the detected flux through multiple iso-distance contours to the lesionâ€™s boundary, and trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify absent, regular, or irregular streaks. Barata~ \etal~ _cite_ proposed using directional filters in dermoscopy images to detect the presence of pigment networks. They formed feature vectors used for classification based on the density and distribution properties of the detected pigment networks. \subsubsection* {Deep Learning to Segment and Classify Skin Lesions} Previous work has shown convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to be useful for both skin lesion segmentation and classification tasks~ _cite_ . CNNs have stacked layers of convolution filters with, commonly, millions of free parameters (also called weights) that learn to represent the data at different levels of abstraction~ _cite_ . These free parameters are often learned through a training process where example images and their corresponding labels (e.g., diagnoses or segmentation masks) are used to update the CNN's free parameters such that the network learns to produce outputs that match the labels. In order to learn free parameters that give a useful abstraction of the data, CNNs often are trained on large datasets of images. As existing skin datasets are relatively small, a common approach~ _cite_ is to use the parameters of a CNN already trained over a larger dataset~ _cite_ . This leverages the useful data abstractions learned over larger datasets for smaller datasets. \subsubsection* {S rensen-Dice-F _inline_eq_ Score as a Loss Function} Training a CNN typically requires minimizing a loss function. As the network model parameters are updated to minimize the loss, the choice of the loss function influences the resulting trained model. The S rensen-Dice coefficient or F _inline_eq_ score has been proposed as a loss function for imbalanced datasets~ _cite_ . We note that the S rensen-Dice coefficient and the F _inline_eq_ score are equivalent (discussed in Section~ _ref_) . Pastor-Pellicer~ \etal~ _cite_ proposed the negative F _inline_eq_ score as a loss function for neural networks in order to clean and enhance ancient document images. Milletari \etal~ _cite_ proposed using the S rensen-Dice coefficient as the loss function for a neural network designed for volumetric segmentation. Sudre \etal~ _cite_ proposed using the S rensen-Dice coefficient weighted by the size of the object within the image as the neural network loss function for ND and ND segmentation. \subsubsection* {Skin Lesion Datasets and Competitions} Korotkov \etal~ _cite_ noted that one of the major limitations of computerized skin lesion analysis research is the lack of standardized skin lesion datasets, and that the ``creation of such a dataset is of utmost importance for future development of this field". Fortunately, since this review, new skin lesion datasets have become available such as DermoFit~ _cite_, and PH _inline_eq_ ~ _cite_ . More recently, the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), began hosting a skin lesion analysis competition~ _cite_ . In addition to providing a standardized dataset, this public competition offers standard evaluation procedures and metrics in order to benchmark lesion segmentation, dermoscopic feature detection, and lesion classification approaches. In this work, we focus on of the N ISIC-ISBI challenge~ _cite_ . This task involves classifying superpixels that may contain a specific clinical dermoscopic feature. \subsubsection* {Contributions} In this work, we detail our proposed approach that reformulates the superpixel classification task as a segmentation problem, and finetunes a pretrained CNN to detect pixels that contain the studied clinical features. Our CNN architecture is modified for semantic segmentation, and is trained to minimize a negative multi-label fuzzy S rensen-Dice-FN score, where the score is computed over partitions of the mini-batch. This approach ranked first place in the task~ _cite_, which used the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) to evaluate submissions. We discuss the limitations of the metrics used to rank the challenge entries, and show two simple baseline methods that empirically outperform all entries when ranked by the current and past challenge metrics. We propose to use a fuzzy Jaccard Index that ignores the empty set (\ie when neither predicted nor ground contain positive values) to rank model performance, rather than AUROC. We plan to publicly release our trained model along with the code used to create and train the model.
