{In viticulture the epicuticular wax as the outer layer of the berry skin is known as trait which is correlated to resilience towards Botrytis bunch rot. Traditionally this trait is classified using the OIV descriptor N (berry bloom) in a time consuming way resulting in subjective and error-prone phenotypic data. In the present study an objective, fast and sensor-based approach was developed to monitor berry bloom. From the technical point-of-view, it is known that the measurement of different illumination components conveys important information about observed object surfaces. A Mobile Light-Separation-Lab is proposed in order to capture illumination-separated images of grapevine berries for phenotyping the distribution of epicuticular waxes (berry bloom) . For image analysis, an efficient convolutional neural network approach is used to derive the uniformity and intactness of waxes on berries. Method validation over six grapevine cultivars shows accuracies up to N \%. In addition, electrical impedance of the cuticle and its epicuticular waxes (described as an indicator for the thickness of berry skin and its permeability) was correlated to the detected proportion of waxes with r = N This novel, fast and non-invasive phenotyping approach facilitates enlarged screenings within grapevine breeding material and genetic repositories regarding berry bloom characteristics and its impact on resilience towards Botrytis bunch rot.}
