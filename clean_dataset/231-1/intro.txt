Connectomics has become a fervent field of study in neuroscience and computer vision recently. The goal of EM connectomics is to reconstruct the neural wiring diagram from Electron Microscopic (EM) images of animal brain. Neural reconstruction of EM images consists of two equally important tasks: (N) trace the anatomical structure of each neuron by labeling each voxel within a cell with a unique id; and (N) find the location and direction of synaptic connections among multiple cells. The enormous amount of EM volume emerging from a tiny amount of tissue constrains any subsequent analysis to be performed (semi-) automatically to acquire a comprehensive knowledge within a practical time period~ _cite_ _cite_ . Discovering the anatomical structure entails a ND segmentation of EM volume. Numerous studies have addressed this task with many different approaches, we refer interested readers to~ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ for further details. In order to unveil the connectivity, it is necessary to identify the locations the direction of synaptic communications between two or more cells. Resolving the location of synaptic contact is crucial for neurobiological reasons, and, because the strength of connection between two cells is determined by the number of times they make a synaptic contact. The direction of the synaptic contact reveals the direction of information flow from presynaptic to postsynaptic cells. By defining the edges, the location and connectivity orientation of synapses complete the directed network of neural circuitry that a neural reconstruction seek to discover. In fact, discovering synaptic connectivity was one of the primary reasons to employ the immensely complex and expensive apparatus of electron microscopy for connectomics in the first place. Other imaging modalities (e.g., light microscopy) are either limited by their resolution or by a conclusive and exhaustive strategy (e.g., using reagents) to locate synapses~ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . In terms of complexity, identification of neural connectivity is as challenging as tracing the neurons~ _cite_ . With rapid and outstanding improvement in automated EM segmentation in recent years, detection of synaptic connectivity may soon become a bottleneck in the overall neural reconstruction process~ _cite_ . Although fewer in number when compared against those in neurite segmentation, there are past studies on synaptic connectivity detection; we mention some notable works in the relevant literature section below. Despite many discernible merits of previous works, very few of them aim to identify both the location and direction of synaptic junctions. Among these few methods, namely by~ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_, none of them have been shown to be generally applicable on different types of synapses typically found on different species of animals, e.g., dyadic connections in vertebrate (mouse, rat, zebrafinch, etc.) and polyadic connections in non-vertebrate (fruit fly) brain . Apart from a few, the past approaches do not benefit from the advantages deep (fully) convolutional networks offer. Use of hand crafted features could stifle the utility of a method on widely divergent EM volumes collected from different animals with different tissue processing and imaging techniques. In this paper, we propose a general method to automatically detect both the ND location and direction of both dyadic (vertebrate) and polyadic (fruit fly) synaptic contacts. The proposed algorithm is designed to predict the proximity (and polarity, as we will explain later) of every ND voxel to a synaptic cleft using a deep fully convolutional network, namely a U-net~ _cite_ . A set of putative locations, along with their connection direction estimates, are computed given a segmentation of the volume and the voxelwise prediction from the U-net. A second stage of pruning, performed by a deep convolutional network, then trims the set of candidates to produce the final prediction of ND synaptic cleft locations and the corresponding directions. The use of CNNs makes the proposed approach generally applicable to new data without the need for feature selection. Estimation of the location and connectivity at both voxel and segment level improves the accuracy but do not require any additional annotation effort (no need for labels for other classes such as vesicles) . We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing approaches for synaptic connectivity detection on both vertebrate and fruit fly datasets. Our evaluation measure (Section~ _ref_), which is critical to assess the actual performance of a synapse detection method, has also been confirmed by a prominent neurobiologist to correctly quantify actual mistakes on real dataset. Initial studies on automatic synaptic detection focused on identifying the cleft location by classical machine learning/vision approaches using pre-defined features~ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . These algorithms assumed subsequent human intervention to determine the synaptic partners given the cleft predictions. Roncal et al.~ _cite_ combine the information provided by membrane and vesicle predictions with a CNN (not fully convolutional) and apply post-processing to locate synaptic clefts. To establish the pre-and post-synaptic partnership, ~ _cite_ augmented the synaptic cleft detection with a multi-layer perceptron operating on hand designed features. On the other hand, Kreshuk et al.~ _cite_ seek to predict vesicles and clefts for each neuron boundary by a random forest classifier (RF) and then aggregate these predictions with a CRF to determine the connectivity for polyadic synapses in fruit fly. Dorkenwald et al.~ _cite_ utilize multiple CNNs, RFs to locate synaptic junctions as well as vesicles, mitochondria, and to decide the dyadic orientation in vertebrate EM data. SynEM~ _cite_ attempts to predict connectivity by classifying each neuron boundary (interfaces) to be synaptic or not using a RF classifier operating on a confined neighborhood and has been shown to perform better than~ _cite_ in terms of connectivity detection.
