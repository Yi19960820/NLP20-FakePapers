Neural network based methods were once widely applied for localizing faces~ _cite_, but they were soon replaced by various non-neural network-based face detectors, which are based on cascade structure~ _cite_ and deformable part models (DPM) ~ _cite_ detectors. Deep convolutional networks (DCN) have recently achieved remarkable performance in many computer vision tasks, such as object detection, object classification, and face recognition. Given the recent advances of deep learning and graphical processing units (GPUs), it is worthwhile to revisit the face detection problem from the neural network perspective. In this study, we wish to design a deep convolutional network for face detection, with the aim of not only exploiting the representation learning capacity of DCN, but also formulating a novel way for handling the severe occlusion issue, which has been a bottleneck in face detection. To this end, we design a new deep convolutional network with the following appealing properties: (N) It is robust to severe occlusion. As depicted in Fig.~ _ref_, our method can detect faces even more than half of the face region is occluded; (N) it is capable of detecting faces with large pose variation, \eg~profile view without training separate models under different viewpoints; (N) it accepts full image of arbitrary size and the faces of different scales can appear anywhere in the image. All the aforementioned properties, which are challenging to achieve with conventional approaches, are made possible with the following considerations: \noindent (N) Generating face parts responses from attribute-aware deep networks: We believe the reasoning of unique structure of local facial parts (\eg eyes, nose, mouths) is the key to address face detection in unconstrained environment. To this end, we design a set of attribute-aware deep networks, which are pre-trained with generic objects and then fine-tuned with specific part-level binary attributes (\eg~mouth attributes including big lips, opened mouth, smiling, wearing lipstick) . We show that these networks could generate response maps in deep layers that strongly indicate the locations of the parts. The examples depicted in Fig.~ _ref_ (b) show the responses maps (known as `partness map' in our paper) of five different face parts. \noindent (N) Computing faceness score from responses configurations: Given the parts responses, we formulate an effective method to reason the degree of face likeliness through analysing their spatial arrangement. For instance, the hair should appear above the eyes, and the mouth should only appear below the nose. Any inconsistency would be penalized. Faceness scores will be derived and used to re-rank candidate windows of any generic object proposal generator to obtain a set of face proposals. Our experiment shows that our face proposal enjoys a high recall with just modest number of proposals (over N \% of face recall with around _inline_eq_ proposals, _inline_eq_ N \% of full sliding windows, and _inline_eq_ N \% of generic object proposals) . \noindent (N) Refining the face hypotheses--Both the aforementioned components offer us the chance to find a face even under severe occlusion and pose variations. The output of these components is a small set of high-quality face bounding box proposals that cover most faces in an image. Given the face proposals, we design a multitask deep convolutional network in the second stage to refine the hypotheses further, by simultaneously recognizing the true faces and estimating more precise face locations. Our main contribution in this study is the novel use of DCN for discovering facial parts responses from arbitrary uncropped face images. Interestingly, in our method, part detectors emerge within CNN trained to classify attributes from uncropped face images, without any part supervision. This is new in the literature. We leverage this new capability to further propose a face detector that is robust to severe occlusion. Our network achieves the state-of-the-art performance on challenging face detection benchmarks including FDDB, PASCAL Faces, and AFW. We show that practical runtime speed can be achieved albeit the use of DCN.
