We propose a novel skeleton-based representation for ND action recognition in videos using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs) . Two key issues have been addressed: First, how to construct a robust representation that easily captures the spatial-temporal evolutions of motions from skeleton sequences. Second, how to design D-CNNs capable of learning discriminative features from the new representation in a effective manner. To address these tasks, a skeleton-based representation, namely, SPMF (S keleton P ose-M otion F eature) is proposed. The SPMFs are built from two of the most important properties of a human action: postures and their motions. Therefore, they are able to effectively represent complex actions. For learning and recognition tasks, we design and optimize new D-CNNs based on the idea of Inception Residual networks to predict actions from SPMFs. Our method is evaluated on two challenging datasets including MSR ActionND and NTU-RGB + D. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods whilst requiring less computation.
