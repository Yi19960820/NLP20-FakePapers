Given the progress in image recognition with recent data driven paradigms, it's still expensive to manually label a large training data to fit a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This paper proposes a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method combining a pre-trained AlexNet with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract image topics from both an unlabeled life-logging dataset and the COCO dataset. We generate the bag-of-words representations of an egocentric dataset from the softmax layer of AlexNet and use LDA to visualize the subject's living genre with duplicated images. We use a subset of COCO on _inline_eq_ categories as ground truth, and define consistent rate to quantitatively analyze the performance of the method, it achieves _inline_eq_ for consistent rate on average comparing to _inline_eq_ from a raw CNN model. The method is capable of detecting false labels and multi-labels from COCO dataset. For scalability test, parallelization experiments are conducted with Harp-LDA on a Intel Knights Landing cluster: to extract _inline_eq_ topic assignments for _inline_eq_ COCO images, it takes _inline_eq_ minutes with _inline_eq_ threads.
