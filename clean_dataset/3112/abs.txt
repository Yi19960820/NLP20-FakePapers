Whole brain segmentation on a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential in non-invasive investigation for neuroanatomy. Historically, multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard method for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches have been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or ND slices. Yet, few previous efforts have been made on detailed whole brain segmentation using ND networks due to the following challenges: (N) fitting entire whole brain volume into ND networks is restricted by the current GPU memory, and (N) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., _inline_eq_ N labels) with limited number of training ND volumes (e.g., _inline_eq_ N scans) . In this paper, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent ND fully convolutional networks to cover overlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the whole brain learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing canonical registration and label fusion techniques with deep learning. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on N initially unlabeled scans were created by MAS for pre-training. From empirical validation, the state-of-the-art MAS method achieved mean Dice value of N, N, and N, while the proposed method achieved N, N, and N on three validation cohorts. Moreover, the computational time reduced from _inline_eq_ N hours using MAS to _inline_eq_ N minutes using the proposed method. The source code is available online .
