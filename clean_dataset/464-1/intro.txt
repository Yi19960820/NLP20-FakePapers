Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among US women (excluding skin cancers), accounting for N \% of all new cancer diagnoses in women in the United States _cite_ . Breast tissue biopsies allow the pathologists to histologically assess the microscopic structure and elements of the tissue. Histopathology aims to distinguish between normal tissue, non-malignant (benign) and malignant lesions (carcinomas) and to perform a prognostic evaluation _cite_ . A combination of hematoxylin and eosin (H \&E) is the principal stain of tissue specimens for routine histopathological diagnostics. There are multiple types of breast carcinomas that embody characteristic tissue morphology, see Fig. _ref_ . Breast carcinomas arise from the mammary epithelium and cause a pre-malignant epithelial proliferation within the ducts, called ductal carcinoma in situ . Invasive carcinoma is characterized by the cancer cells gaining the capacity to break through the basal membrane of the duct walls and infiltrate into surrounding tissues _cite_ . Morphology of tissue, cells, and subcellular compartments is regulated by complex biological mechanisms related to cell differentiation, development, and cancer _cite_ . Traditionally, morphological assessment and tumor grading were visually performed by the pathologist, however, this process is tedious and subjective, causing inter-observer variations even among senior pathologists _cite_ . The subjectivity of the application of morphological criteria in visual classification motivates the use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to improve the diagnosis accuracy, reduce human error, increase the level of inter-observer agreement, and increased reproducibility _cite_ . There are many methods developed for the digital pathology image analysis, from rule-based to applications of machine learning _cite_ . Recently, deep learning based approaches were shown to outperform conventional machine learning methods in many image analysis task, automating end-to-end processing _cite_ . In the domain of medical imaging, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully used for diabetic retinopathy screening _cite_, bone disease prediction _cite_ and age assessment _cite_, and other problems _cite_ . Previous deep learning-based applications in histological microscopic image analysis have demonstrated their potential to provide utility in diagnosing breast cancer _cite_ . In this paper, we present an approach for histology microscopy image analysis for breast cancer type classification. Our approach utilizes deep CNNs for feature extraction and gradient boosted trees for classification and, to our knowledge, outperforms other similar solutions.
