Keypoint detection on unconstrained faces is one of the most studied topics in the past decade, as accurate localization of fiducials is a vital pre-processing task for variety of applications. In the last five years, keypoint localization using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) has received great attention from computer vision researchers. This is mainly due to the availability of large scale annotated unconstrained face datasets such as AFLW _cite_ . Works such as _cite_ have hypothesized that as the network gets deeper more abstract information such as identity, pose, attributes are retained while immediate local features are lost. However, various methods _cite_, _cite_, and _cite_ directly use CNNs as regressors or use deep features from CNNs to design regressors for predicting keypoints. On the other hand, an earlier method of Explicit Shape Regression (ESR) proposed by Cao et al. _cite_ achieved superior results by introducing the important concept of non-parametric shape regression for facial keypoint localization. Following _cite_, unconstrained face alignment received great deal of attention and many of its variants _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_ were published later, using a variety of features producing incremental improvements over _cite_ . However, they are all limited by the fixed number of points on the face. In real life applications, there are more challenging datasets such as IJBA _cite_ and AFW _cite_, which do not always have N or N fixed points mainly due to occlusion or pose variations. As alternatives, researchers moved towards more sophisticated techniques, incorporating ND shape models _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, domain learning _cite_, recurrent autoencoder-decoder _cite_ and many others. However, one question still remains unanswered: Can cascaded shape regression be applied for an arbitrary face with no prior knowledge ? The motivation for this work is to adapt cascaded regression for predicting landmarks of arbitrary faces, while taking advantage of CNNs. We transform the cascaded regression formulation into an iterative scheme for arbitrary faces. In each iteration the regressor predicts the increment for the next stage jointly for all the points while maintaining the shape constraint. As by-products of KEPLER, we get the visibility confidence of each keypoint and ND pose (pitch, yaw and roll) for the face image. The main contributions of this paper are: The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews closely related works. Section III presents the proposed method in detail. Section IV describes the experiments and comparisons, which are then followed by conclusions and suggestions for future works in section V.
