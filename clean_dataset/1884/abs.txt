This paper introduces a Deep Scattering network that utilizes Dual-Tree complex wavelets to extract translation invariant representations from an input signal. The computationally efficient Dual-Tree wavelets decompose the input signal into densely spaced representations over scales. Translation invariance is introduced in the representations by applying a non-linearity over a region followed by averaging. The discriminatory information in the densely spaced, locally smooth, signal representations aids the learning of the classifier. The proposed network is shown to outperform Mallat's ScatterNet~ _cite_ on four datasets with different modalities on classification accuracy.
