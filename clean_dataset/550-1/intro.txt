Depth estimation from stereo images is essential to computer vision applications, including autonomous driving for vehicles, ND model reconstruction, and object detection and recognition~ _cite_ . Given a pair of rectified stereo images, the goal of depth estimation is to compute the disparity _inline_eq_ for each pixel in the reference image. Disparity refers to the horizontal displacement between a pair of corresponding pixels on the left and right images. For the pixel _inline_eq_ in the left image, if its corresponding point is found at _inline_eq_ in the right image, then the depth of this pixel is calculated by _inline_eq_, where _inline_eq_ is the camera \textquotesingle s focal length and _inline_eq_ is the distance between two camera centers. The typical pipeline for stereo matching involves the finding of corresponding points based on matching cost and post-processing. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to learn how to match corresponding points in MC-CNN~ _cite_ . Early approaches using CNNs treated the problem of correspondence estimation as similarity computation~ _cite_, where CNNs compute the similarity score for a pair of image patches to further determine whether they are matched. Although CNN yields significant gains compared to conventional approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed, it is still difficult to find accurate corresponding points in inherently ill-posed regions such as occlusion areas, repeated patterns, textureless regions, and reflective surfaces. Solely applying the intensity-consistency constraint between different viewpoints is generally insufficient for accurate correspondence estimation in such ill-posed regions, and is useless in textureless regions. Therefore, regional support from global context information must be incorporated into stereo matching. One major problem with current CNN-based stereo matching methods is how to effectively exploit context information. Some studies attempt to incorporate semantic information to largely refine cost volumes or disparity maps~ _cite_ . The Displets~ _cite_ method utilizes object information by modeling ND vehicles to resolve ambiguities in stereo matching. ResMatchNet~ _cite_ learns to measure reflective confidence for the disparity maps to improve performance in ill-posed regions. GC-Net~ _cite_ employs the encoder-decoder architecture to merge multiscale features for cost volume regularization. In this work, we propose a novel pyramid stereo matching network (PSMNet) to exploit global context information in stereo matching. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) ~ _cite_ and dilated convolution~ _cite_ are used to enlarge the receptive fields. In this way, PSMNet extends pixel-level features to region-level features with different scales of receptive fields; the resultant combined global and local feature clues are used to form the cost volume for reliable disparity estimation. Moreover, we design a stacked hourglass ND CNN in conjunction with intermediate supervision to regularize the cost volume. The stacked hourglass ND CNN repeatedly processes the cost volume in a top-down/bottom-up manner to further improve the utilization of global context information.
