Automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels from fundus images plays an important role in the computer aided diagnosis of retinal diseases. The task of blood vessel segmentation is challenging due to the extreme variations in morphology of the vessels against noisy background. In this paper, we formulate the segmentation task as a multi-label inference task and utilize the implicit advantages of the combination of convolutional neural networks and structured prediction. Our proposed convolutional neural network based model achieves strong performance and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for automatic retinal blood vessel segmentation on DRIVE dataset with _inline_eq_ accuracy and _inline_eq_ AUC score.
