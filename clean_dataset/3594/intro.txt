\noindent This paper addresses the problem of checkerboard artifacts generated by some super-resolution (SR) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) . SR methods using CNNs have been widely studying as one of single image SR techniques, and have superior performances _cite_ . Moreover, in order to accelerate the processing speed, CNNs including upsampling layers such as deconvolution _cite_ and sub-pixel convolution _cite_ ones have been proposed _cite_ . However, it is well-known that these SR methods generate periodic artifacts, referred to as checkerboard artifacts _cite_ . \par In CNNs, it is well-known that checkerboard artifacts are generated by operations of deconvolution, sub-pixel convolution layers _cite_ . To overcome these artifacts, smoothness constraint _cite_, post-processing _cite_, initialization scheme _cite_ and different upsampling layer designs _cite_ have been proposed. Most of them can not avoid checkerboard artifacts perfectly, although they reduce the artifacts. Among them, Odena et al. _cite_ have demonstrated that checkerboard artifacts can be perfectly avoided by using resize convolution layers instead of deconvolution ones. However, the resize convolution layers can not be directly applied to upsampling layers such as deconvolution and sub-pixel convolution ones, so this method needs not only large memory but also high computational costs. \par On the other hand, checkerboard artifacts have been studied to design linear multirate systems including filter banks and wavelets _cite_ . In addition, it is well-known that checkerboard artifacts are caused by the time-variant property of interpolators in multirate systems, and the condition for avoiding these artifacts have been given _cite_ . However, the condition to avoid checkerboard artifacts for linear systems can not be applied to CNNs due to the non-linearity of CNNs. \par In this paper, we extend the avoiding condition for CNNs, and apply the proposed structure to SR methods using deconvolution and sub-pixel convolution layers to confirm the effectiveness of the new scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed structure can perfectly avoid to generate checkerboard artifacts under two loss conditions: mean square error and perceptual loss, while keeping excellent properties that the SR methods have. As a result, it is confirmed that the proposed structure allows us to offer efficient SR methods without any checkerboard artifacts.
