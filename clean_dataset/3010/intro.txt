Automatic detection and segmentation of fluid within retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is a task of great importance to the field of ophthalmology. Fluid is not normally present in the retina and its presence decreases visual acuity thus mandating therapeutic intervention. Three types of fluid occur in the retina: intaretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) . To automatically and simultaneously detect and quantify these fluid types, we propose a deep learning based algorithm. Toward this end, we constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes as input a single _inline_eq_-plane slice from an OCT image and produces a map showing the probabilities of each pixel containing each fluid type as output. We also designed a post-processing framework centered on the graph cut algorithm to produce a final segmentation from the CNN output. \noindent Related works. Deep learning is currently revolutionizing many fields of automated image analysis _cite_, and recent advances in GPU hardware alongside novel algorithms have made it possible to apply these methods to medical imaging. In our context, the most significant recent non-hardware development is the use of deconvolution layers to perform bilinear upsampling within a CNN~ _cite_, which allows the output to be the same size as the input despite the use of subsampling operations in the CNN. Prior published work dealing with simultaneous detection and segmentation of IRF, SRF, and PED in OCT images of the human retina can be found in~ _cite_ . There are also studies dealing with binary detection of either fluid in general or only one specific type of fluid~ _cite_ . Our method is closest to that of~ _cite_, the differences being our use of a deep CNN instead of their initialization method along with simpler post-processing methodology. Interestingly, we demonstrate good performance without utilizing a retinal layer segmentation.
