This paper presents a compositional, attentional model for answering questions about a variety of world representations, including images and structured knowledge bases. The model translates from questions to dynamically assembled neural networks, then applies these networks to world representations (images or knowledge bases) to produce answers. We take advantage of two largely independent lines of work: on one hand, an extensive literature on answering questions by mapping from strings to logical representations of meaning; on the other, a series of recent successes in deep neural models for image recognition and captioning. By constructing neural networks instead of logical forms, our model leverages the best aspects of both linguistic compositionality and continuous representations. Our model has two components, trained jointly: first, a collection of neural ``modules'' that can be freely composed (_ref_ a) ; second, a network layout predictor that assembles modules into complete deep networks tailored to each question (_ref_ b) . Previous work has used manually-specified modular structures for visual learning _cite_ . Here we: Training data consists of (world, question, answer) triples: our approach requires no supervision of network layouts. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two markedly different question answering tasks: one with questions about natural images, and another with more compositional questions about United States geography.
