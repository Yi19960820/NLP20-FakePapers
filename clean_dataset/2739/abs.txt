Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and leading cancer-related death causes for women. In the context of ICIAR N Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology Images, we compare one handcrafted feature extractor and five transfer learning feature extractors based on deep learning. We find out that the deep learning networks pretrained on ImageNet have better performance than the popular handcrafted features used for breast cancer histology images. The best feature extractor achieves an average accuracy of N \%. To improve the classification performance, a random forest dissimilarity based integration method is used to combine different feature groups together. When the five deep learning feature groups are combined, the average accuracy is improved to N \% (best accuracy N \%) . When handcrafted features are combined with the five deep learning feature groups, the average accuracy is improved to N \% (best accuracy N \%) .
