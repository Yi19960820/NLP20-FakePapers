Image smoothing, a fundamental technology in image processing and computer vision, aims to clean images by retaining salient structures (to the structure-only image) and removing insignificant textures (to the texture-only image), with various applications including denoising _cite_, detail enhancement _cite_, image abstraction _cite_ and segmentation _cite_ . There are mainly two types of methods for image smoothing: (N) kernel-based methods, that calculate the average of the neighborhood for texture pixels while trying to retain the original value for structural pixels, such as the guided filter (GF) _cite_, rolling guidance filter (RGF) _cite_, segment graph filter (SGF) _cite_ and so on; and (N) separation-based methods, which decompose the image into a structure layer and a texture layer, such as relative total variation (RTV) _cite_, fast LN _cite_, and static and dynamic guidance filter (SDF) _cite_ . Traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted features and/or prior knowledge to distinguish textures from structures. These features are based entirely on low-level appearance, and generally assume that structures always have larger gradients, and textures are just smaller oscillations in color intensities. In fact, it is quite difficult to identify textures. The main reasons are twofold: (N) textures are essentially repeated patterns regularly or irregularly distributed within object structures, and they may show significant spatial distortions in an image (as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ (a)), making it impossible to fully define them mathematically; (N) in some images there are strong textures with large gradients and color contrast to the background, which are easy to confuse with structures (such as the white stripes on the giraffe's body in Fig.~ _ref_ (c)) . We see from Fig.~ _ref_ that GF, RGF, SGF, fast LN, and SDF perform poorly on the giraffe image. The textures are either not removed at all, or suppressed with the structure severely blurred. This is because the hand-crafted nature of these filters makes them less robust when applied to various types of textures, and also leads to poor discrimination of textures and structures. Some other methods _cite_ take advantage of deep neural networks, and aim for better performance by extracting richer information. However, existing networks use the output of various hand-crafted filters as ground-truth during training. These deep learning approaches are thus limited by the shortcomings of hand-crafted filters, and cannot learn how to effectively distinguish textures from structures. A recently-proposed double-guided filter (DGF) _cite_ addresses this issue by introducing the idea of ``texture guidance", which infers the location of texture, and combines it with ``structure guidance" to achieve both goals of texture removal and structure preservation. However, DGF uses a hand-crafted separation-based algorithm called Structure Gradient and Texture Decorrelating (SGTD) _cite_ to construct the texture confidence map that still cannot essentially overcome the natural deficiency. We argue that this is not true ``texture awareness", because in many cases, some structures are inevitably blurred when the filter tries to remove strong textures after several iterations. As can be seen in Fig.~ _ref_ (i), although the stripe textures are largely smoothed out, the structure of the giraffe is unexpectedly blurred, especially around the head and the tail (red boxes) . In this paper, we hold the idea that ``texture awareness" should reflect both the texture region (where the texture is) and texture magnitude (texture with high contrast to the background is harder to remove) . Thus, we take advantage of deep learning and propose a texture prediction network (TPN) that aims to learn textures from natural images. However, since there are no available datasets containing natural images with labeled texture regions, we make use of texture-only datasets _cite_ . The process of learning ``texture awareness" is shown in Fig.~ _ref_ (b) . Specifically, we generate the training data by adding spatial and color variations to natural texture patterns and blending them with the structure-only image. Then we construct a multi-scale network (containing different levels of contextual information) to train these images with texture ground-truth (G.T. in short) . The proposed TRN is able to predict textures through a full consideration of both high-level statistics, e.g., repetition, tiling, spatial varying distortion; and low-level appearance, e.g., gradient. The network achieves good performance on our generated testing data, and can also generalize well to natural images, effectively locating texture regions and measuring texture magnitude by assigning different confidences, as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ (b) . More details can be found in Section~ _ref_ . For the full problem, we are inspired by the idea of ``double guidance" introduced in _cite_ and propose a deep neural network based filter that learns to predict textures to remove (``texture-awareness" by our TPN) and structures to preserve (``structure-awareness" by HED semantic edge detection _cite_) . This is an end-to-end image smoothing architecture which we refer to as ``Texture and Structure Aware Filtering Network" (TSAFN), as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ (c) . The network is trained with our own generated dataset. Different from the work in _cite_, we propose more effective methods for generating texture and structure guidance, and replace the hand-crafted kernel filter with a deep learning based one to achieve a more consistent and effective combination of these two types of guidance. Experimental results show that our proposed filter outperforms DGF _cite_ significantly in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, and generalizes well to natural images. The main contributions of this paper are: (N) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose deep neural networks to robustly predict textures in natural images. (N) We present a large dataset that enables training texture prediction and image smoothing. (N) We propose an end-to-end deep neural network for image smoothing that achieves both ``structure-awareness" and ``texture-awareness", and outperforms existing methods on challenging natural images.
