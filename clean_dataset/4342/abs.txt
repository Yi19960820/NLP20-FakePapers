The discriminative power of modern deep learning models for ND human action recognition is growing ever so potent. In conjunction with the recent resurgence of ND human action representation with ND skeletons, the quality and the pace of recent progress have been significant. However, the inner workings of state-of-the-art learning based methods in ND human action recognition still remain mostly black-box. In this work, we propose to use a new class of models known as Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCN) for ND human action recognition. Compared to popular LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network models, given interpretable input such as ND skeletons, TCN provides us a way to explicitly learn readily interpretable spatio-temporal representations for ND human action recognition. We provide our strategy in re-designing the TCN with interpretability in mind and how such characteristics of the model is leveraged to construct a powerful ND activity recognition method. Through this work, we wish to take a step towards a spatio-temporal model that is easier to understand, explain and interpret. The resulting model, Res-TCN, achieves state-of-the-art results on the largest ND human action recognition dataset, NTU-RGBD.
