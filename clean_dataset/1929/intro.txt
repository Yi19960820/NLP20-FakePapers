ND shape analysis has become increasingly important with the advances of shape scanning and processing techniques. Shape retrieval and classification are two fundamental tasks of ND shape analysis, with diverse applications in archeology, virtual reality, medical diagnosis, etc. ND shapes generally include rigid shapes, e.g., CAD models, and non-rigid shapes such as human surfaces with non-rigid deformations. A fundamental problem in non-rigid shape analysis is shape representation. Traditional shape representation methods are mostly based on local artificial descriptors such as shape context~ _cite_, mesh sift~ _cite_, spin images~ _cite_, etc., and they have shown effective performance especially for shape matching and recognition. These descriptors are further modeled as middle level shape descriptors by Bag-of-Words model~ _cite_, VLAD~ _cite_, etc., and then applied to shape classification and retrieval. For shapes with non-rigid deformations, the model in~ _cite_ generalize shape descriptors from Euclidean metrics to non-Euclidean metrics. The spectral descriptors, which are built on spectral decomposition of Laplace Beltrami operator defined on ND surface, are popular in non-rigid shape representation. Typical spectral descriptors include diffusion distance~ _cite_, heat kernel signature~ (HKS) ~ _cite_, wave kernel signature~ (WKS) ~ _cite_ and scale invariant heat kernel signature~ (SIHKS) ~ _cite_ . In~ _cite_, spectral descriptors of SIHKS and WKS using a Large Margin Nearest Neighbor~ (LMNN) embedding achieved state-of-the-art results for non-rigid shape retrieval. Spectral descriptors are commonly intrinsic and invariant to isometric deformations, therefore effective for non-rigid shape analysis. Recently, a promising trend in non-rigid shape representation is the learning-based methods on ND surface for tasks of non-rigid shape retrieval and classification. Many learning-based methods take low-level shape descriptors as inputs and extract high-level descriptors by integrating over the entire shape. In the work of~ _cite_, they first extract SIHKS and WKS, and then integrate them to form a global descriptor followed by LMNN embedding. Global shape descriptors are learned by Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network in~ _cite_ based on spectral descriptors. The eigen-shape and Fisher-shape descriptors are learned by a modified auto-encoder based on spectral descriptors in~ _cite_ . These works have shown impressive results in learning global shape descriptors. Though these advances have been achieved, designing learning-based methods on ND surface is still an emerging and challenging task, including how to design feature aggregation and feature learning on ND surface for non-rigid shape representation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based spectral transform network on ND surface to learn discriminative shape descriptor for non-rigid shape retrieval and classification. First, we define a second-order pooling operation on ND surface which models the second-order statistics of input raw descriptors on ND surfaces. Second, considering that the pooled second-order descriptors lie on a manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices (SPDM-manifold), we define a novel manifold transform for feature learning by learning a on the singular values of the SPDM descriptors. Third, by concatenating the stages of raw descriptor extraction, surface second-order pooling, transform on SPDM-manifold and metric learning, we propose a novel network architecture, dubbed as as shown in Fig.~ _ref_, which can learn discriminative shape descriptors for non-rigid shape analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that learns second-order pooling-based shape descriptors on ND surfaces using a network architecture. Our network structure is simple and easily to be trained, and is justified to be able to significantly improve the discriminative ability of input raw descriptors. It is adaptive to various non-rigid shapes such as watertight meshes, partial meshes and point cloud data. It achieved competitive results on challenging benchmarks for non-rigid shape retrieval and classification, e.g., _inline_eq_ accuracy on SHREC'N~ _cite_ dataset and the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ``range'' subset of SHREC'N~ _cite_ in metric of NN~ _cite_ .
