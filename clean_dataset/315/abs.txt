We propose a novel subgraph image representation for classification of network fragments with the targets being their parent networks. The graph image representation is based on ND image embeddings of adjacency matrices. We use this image representation in two modes. First, as the input to a machine learning algorithm. Second, as the input to a pure transfer learner. Our conclusions from several datasets are that
