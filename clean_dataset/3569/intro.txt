Convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in computer vision ever since AlexNet _cite_ popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the ImageNet Challenge: ILSVRC N _cite_ . The general trend has been to make deeper and more complicated networks in order to achieve higher accuracy _cite_ . However, these advances to improve accuracy are not necessarily making networks more efficient with respect to size and speed. In many real world applications such as robotics, self-driving car and augmented reality, the recognition tasks need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform. This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section _ref_ reviews prior work in building small models. Section _ref_ describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section _ref_ describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section _ref_ closes with a summary and conclusion.
