Coronary heart disease is a common cause of death despite being preventable and treatable. Early detection of atherosclerotic plaque deposits can be critical for appropriate treatment. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has established itself as an alternative to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) _cite_ as an imaging modality for invasive coronary angiography. Compared to IVUS, IVOCT is capable of resolving microstructures in the arterial wall which is traded off against a smaller field of view (FOV) _cite_ . During the procedure, a catheter containing an OCT probe is inserted into a coronary artery. For acquisition, the probe is rotated and pulled back automatically, providing several hundred or thousands of high resolution cross-sectional images of the arterial walls which guide the practitioner's treatment decision process during an intervention. The assessment of these images requires extensive training of the interventionalist. Also, the vast amount of images acquired in a single pullback cannot all be reviewed by the practitioner during clinical routine. Therefore, various approaches for automatic IVOCT data analysis have been proposed. For example, automatic lumen segmentation _cite_ and stent detection _cite_ have been proposed. Also, automatic detection of plaque deposits has been proposed. The general feasibility of inferring plaque characteristics from IVOCT data has been addressed by correlating the images to histology data _cite_ . IVOCT has been used to measure the thickness of fibrous caps in the arterial wall to assess the risk of ruptures and potential subsequent myocardial infarction _cite_ . Also, calcified plaque regions have been quantified as they can increase the risk of stenosis _cite_ . In general, the backscattering and attenuation coefficient of the OCT signal have been used frequently for identification of atherosclerotic tissue _cite_ . Also, automatic classification methods using texture and optical properties as features have been proposed for plaque detection and segmentation _cite_ . The segmentation of calcified plaque regions has been proposed using k-means clustering and random forests _cite_ . More recently, deep learning methods have been proposed for IVOCT data processing, e.g. for tissue layer segmentation _cite_ . Deep learning models, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown remarkable success in image processing tasks such as classification _cite_ and segmentation _cite_ . Also for medical tasks, such as disease classification _cite_ or tumor segmentation _cite_, deep learning methods have shown significant improvment over classical methods _cite_ . For IVOCT-based learning problems, CNNs have been employed, mostly in preliminary studies for plaque segmentation. Patch-wise approaches have been presented where a CNN predicts the class of the patch center pixel _cite_ . Following the trend of dense segmentation architectures for improved performance _cite_, SegNet _cite_ has been employed for calcified plaque segmentation _cite_ . Although these approaches provide promising initial results, there are various shortcomings to be addressed. First of all, it is unclear whether learning from polar or cartesian representations is the better choice. Using cartesian images _cite_ is more intuitive as their content resembles the anatomical structure of the artery. However, polar representations _cite_ theoretically contain the same information while not being distorted by circular interpolation artifacts. For this reason, most classic approaches rely on polar images for image processing _cite_ . However, it is unclear whether either or both representations are more suitable for deep learning-based feature extraction. Also, IVOCT acquisition is often accompanied by various artifacts, see Fig.~ _ref_ . Many approaches rely on extensive preprocessing, including lumen segmentation and flattening _cite_ which is hindered by artifacts that block light penetration of the arterial walls. As these artifcats are common in daily clinical use, automatic procedures should be sufficiently robust. Moreover, previous approaches _cite_ are limited in terms of dataset size and model choice (e.g. AlexNet _cite_) . More recent standard architectures such as ResNet _cite_ and Inception _cite_ have been shown to significantly improve performance for medical learning tasks _cite_ . Also, transfer learning from ImageNet has been shown to be advantageous for medical learning problems _cite_ . For IVOCT-based tissue layer segmentation, rudimentary transfer learning with a partially frozen network has been shown _cite_ . Another approach considered full fine-tuning for plaque classification _cite_ . However, the optimal level of meaningful feature transfer and partial retraining has not been explored for IVOCT data. Previously, it has been shown that the optimal choice or transfer strategy varies for different modalities and problems _cite_ which motivates a thorough investigation for IVOCT data. Lastly, previous methods largely relied on segmentation which is a necessary step for treatment planning in many medical applications _cite_ . However, for IVOCT interventions, the key problem is the large number of slices in every pullback. Thus, a clinical decision support system needs to provide feedback on the existence and characteristics of plaque deposits on the pullback level. Overall, a goal of such a system is to ensure that no deposit region remains undetected. For this purpose, segmentation is not immediately required. To overcome these shortcomings, we provide a thorough investigation of IVOCT-based deep learning using a newly built dataset with slice-level labels. Three trained experts provide a class for each slice, defining the plaque type that is present in the image. In this way, we can quickly build a large dataset containing a variety of challenging cases, as indicated in Fig.~ _ref_ . Using this dataset, we investigate important aspects to be considered for deep learning with IVOCT data. First, we study the use of polar and cartesian image representations for deep feature learning. In particular, we use data augmentation techniques, tailored to each representation. To improve model performance, we employ transfer learning from ImageNet using the established models ResNet _cite_ and DenseNet _cite_ . As natural images are vastly different from IVOCT data, we provide an in-depth analysis of transfer learning, showing performance for different transfer strategies. Additionally, we build a new two-path architecture out of pretrained parts from other models that leverages features from both image representations. Overall, we consider binary labels "plaque" and "no plaque", as well as a further differentiation of "calcified plaque" from "fibrous/lipid plaque". This choice is also clinically motivated as calcified plaque deposits often require different tools for treatment, such as rotablation. This paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce our dataset and methods in Section~ _ref_ . Second, we provide results in Section~ _ref_ . Third, we discuss our results in Section~ _ref_ and last, we conclude the paper in Section~ _ref_ .
