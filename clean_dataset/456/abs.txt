Deep learning for regression tasks on medical imaging data has shown promising results. However, compared to other approaches, their power is strongly linked to the dataset size. In this study, we evaluate ND-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and classical regression methods with hand-crafted features for survival time regression of patients with high-grade brain tumors. The tested CNNs for regression showed promising but unstable results. The best performing deep learning approach reached an accuracy of _inline_eq_ on held-out samples of the training set. All tested deep learning experiments were outperformed by a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using N radiomic features. The investigated features included intensity, shape, location and deep features. The submitted method to the BraTS N survival prediction challenge is an ensemble of SVCs, which reached a cross-validated accuracy of _inline_eq_ on the BraTS N training set, _inline_eq_ on the validation set, and _inline_eq_ on the testing set. The results suggest that more training data is necessary for a stable performance of a CNN model for direct regression from magnetic resonance images, and that non-imaging clinical patient information is crucial along with imaging information.
