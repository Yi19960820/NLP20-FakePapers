Videos can be manipulated by duplicating a sequence of consecutive frames with the goal of concealing or imitating a specific content in the same video. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect and localize such frame duplication. First an IND network finds coarse-level matches between candidate duplicated frame sequences and the corresponding selected original frame sequences. Then a Siamese network based on ResNet architecture identifies fine-level correspondences between an individual duplicated frame and the corresponding selected frame. We also propose a robust statistical approach to compute a video-level score indicating likelihood of manipulation or forgery. Additionally, for providing manipulation localization information we develop an inconsistency detector based on the IND network to distinguish the duplicated frames from the selected original frames. Quantified evaluation on two challenging video forgery datasets clearly demonstrates that this approach performs significantly better than four recent state-of-the-art methods.
