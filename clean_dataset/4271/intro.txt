Event recognition from still images is one of the challenging problems in computer vision research. While many efforts have been devoted to the problem of video-based event and action recognition _cite_, there are much fewer research works on image-based event recognition _cite_ . Compared with images, videos are able to provide more useful information for event undertanding such as motion, in addition to static appearance. Therefore, event recognition from still images poses more challenges than videos. Meanwhile, the concept of event itself is extremely complex, as the characterization of an event is related to many factors, including objects, human poses, human garments, scene categories, and other context. Therefore, the event recognition is highly related with other high-level computer vision problems, such as object recognition _cite_ and scene recognition _cite_ . In this paper, we propose an effective method for the track of cultural event recognition at the ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge N _cite_, which obtains the performance of _inline_eq_ and ranks the _inline_eq_ place in this challenge. Specifically, we propose a new architecture for event recognition, called (OS-CNN), which extracts the important visual cues of both object and scene for event understanding. The OS-CNN is decomposed into two separate nets, namely object net and scene net. The object net aggregates important information for recognizing event from the perspective of object, while the scene net performs event recognition with the help of scene context. The cues of containing object and scene context provide complementary information for event understanding from still images. The recognition results from object net and scene net are combined by late fusion. Decoupling the object and scene nets also allows us to exploit the availability of large amounts of annotated image data by pre-training object net on the ImageNet challenge dataset _cite_ and scene net on the Places dataset _cite_ . Meanwhile, there are many famous and successful network architectures for CNNs, such as AlexNet _cite_, ClarifaiNet _cite_, GoogLeNet _cite_, and VGGNet _cite_ . These architectures have proved to be effective for object and scene recognition, and obtained the state-of-the-art performance on the datasets of ImageNet and Places _cite_ . However, their performance on event recognition and the complementarity among them has not been fully explored before. In our proposed OS-CNN, we exploit these successful deep architectures for event recognition, and further boost the recognition performance by using ensemble of them. Finally, based on our OS-CNN and comparative study of different network architectures, we come up with a solution of five-stream CNN for the ChaLearn LAP challenge N. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section _ref_, we describe the technical details about our OS-CNN. We then provide the implementation details and experimental results in Section _ref_ . Finally, we conclude our method and present the future works in Section _ref_ .
