image boundary detection is a fundamental problem in the field of image processing and computer vision. The boundaries can be used as low-level image features for object classification and detection _cite_ . For example, the algorithm proposed by _cite_ detects cows and horses by matching boundary fragments extracted from images. In this case, clean boundary maps are required for follow-up stages. Due to the ambiguity of low-level features and the lack of semantic information, boundary detection remains a challenging problem after decades of active research _cite_ . This letter proposes a and makes efforts to improve the performance of a classical algorithm named _cite_ . A boundary usually refers to the border between two regions with different semantic meanings. Therefore, measuring the dissimilarity between image regions is at the core of boundary detection. In a canonical framework, we first extract local image features, such as brightness histogram, from an image. Then the distance of descriptors from adjacent regions is used as an indicator to boundary response. With a good measurement, the boundary response should be weak inside a sematic region while strong on the border. To find an ideal measurement, both feature extraction and distance calculation are crucial. Earlier researchers prefer relatively simple features and metrics due to limited computing resources. For example, Canny detector introduced by _cite_ uses analytic derivatives of brightness cue to compute boundary response. However, brightness discontinuity exists not only on borders between different regions but also inside a semantic region. The Canny detection results usually contain lots of non-boundary points. A later algorithm named _cite_ suggests combining multiple cues for boundary detection. It proposes a histogram-based feature to fully exploit brightness, color and texture cues. Furthermore, _inline_eq_ difference is adopted to calculate the distance, since it is shown to be more effective in the histogram-based feature space. With the new feature and _inline_eq_ difference, is capable of detecting complex boundaries while eliminating most noise, making a big step forward. proposed by _cite_ is the successor of . Compared with the predecessor, computes the features on multiple scales. As shown in experiments of _cite_, multi-scale cues improve the performance of boundary detection. For both and, one of the highlights is to learn parameters from human annotations in dataset BSDSN _cite_ . By introducing a learning stage, researchers hope to capture the implicit structure of natural image data and further improve the performance. However, the drawback of human-crafted metrics such as the _inline_eq_ difference consist in their limited fitness to the data. In fact, experiments in this letter show that the improvement brought by supervised learning is relatively minor. Inspired by _cite_, we propose to learn a distance metric to substitute the _inline_eq_ difference in . Different from _cite_, the is composed of a single layer neural network and an RBF kernel, and is fine-tuned by strongly supervised learning. After applying LBM, the F-measure metric of on the BSDSN benchmark is increased from N to N The following parts will show details of LBM and evaluation results on BSDSN _cite_ .
