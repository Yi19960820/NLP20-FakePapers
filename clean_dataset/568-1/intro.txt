Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US, responsible for more deaths than breast, prostate, colon and pancreas cancer combined~ _cite_ . Average five year survival for lung cancer is approximately N \% (see e.g.~ _cite_), much lower than other cancer types due to the fact that symptoms of this disease usually only become apparent when the cancer is already at an advanced stage. However, early stage lung cancer (stage I) has a five-year survival of N-N \%. Recently, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that lung cancer mortality can be reduced by at least N \% using a screening program of high-risk populations with low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the chest annually~ _cite_ . A greater mortality reduction has been recently reported in the European Nelson trial~ _cite_ . More complete implementation of such lung cancer screening (LCS) programs at a national level could result in a large volume of CT lung screening (CTLS) scans that need to be assessed by radiologists since the insurance mandated high-risk criteria are met by millions of Americans~ _cite_ . This highlights the potential utility of image analysis tools that can help radiologists to assess malignancy risk associated with a CTLS scan and make recommendations for further work-up, e.g. pulmonologic, oncologic or surgical evaluation. Initial research papers on automated nodule detection were published almost N decades ago~ _cite_, with most of the efforts focusing on chest-radiography and CT scans. More recent works~ _cite_ have employed machine learning methods such as combinations of several classifiers~ _cite_ . In a recent data challenge (Lung Nodule Analysis ~ _cite_), the best performing algorithms have been almost exclusively based on deep learning. Several neural network architectures rely on ND and ND convolutional networks to detect nodules (see e.g., ~ _cite_) . On the topic of nodule malignancy estimation, several recent works rely (at least partially) on deep learning, e.g.~ _cite_ . The majority of previous studies evaluate the malignancy at the nodule level, rather the patient (full volume) level which is considered in this paper. This is beneficial for two reasons, firstly, it allows us to train a model with less information, using only patient outcomes and secondly, it allows us to evaluate the consequences of model performance at patient level. McWilliams ~ _cite_ have proposed the that uses N image and patient features in order to estimate the cancer malignancy risk of a nodule. Moreover, a recent study~ _cite_ has shown that the PanCan Risk Model performs better than Lung-RADS ~ _cite_ and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines version N _cite_, hence highlighting it as a useful benchmark model for our experimental validation. Recently, a data science competition (Kaggle, Data Science Bowl N~ _cite_) was organized on the topic of lung cancer screening that attracted a significant attention from the research community. The authors of the winning entry~ _cite_ proposed a ND convolutional network for nodule detection, using LUNAN dataset and additional manual nodule annotations of the Kaggle dataset to train their nodule detector. Subsequently, five detected nodules were used as inputs for the malignancy risk assessment network. In this paper, we propose a two-stage Machine Learning framework that estimates the cancer risk associated with a given CTLS scan. The first stage employs a detector~ _cite_ that identifies nodules contained within a scan. The second stage employs a neural network inspired by the ResNet architecture~ _cite_, regularized using dropout~ _cite_ that performs the cancer risk assessment of the whole CTLS scan. Our framework is evaluated against three criteria (i) Robustness: we show that our framework achieves consistent performance across different low-dose CT datasets, (ii) Performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA): we show that our framework has improved performance over state-of-the-art models, and (iii) Performance compared to radiologists: we show that our model has comparable performance to a panel of six radiologists.
