A popular strategy for learning a discriminative event detection function, ~ _inline_eq_, is to employ a linear function, where~ _inline_eq_ is a vectorized feature representation of the multi-dimensional event sequence~ _inline_eq_ ; _inline_eq_ is the dimensionality of the signal; and~ _inline_eq_ is the number of frames. This is in contrast to canonical methods for temporal detection in vision such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) ~ _cite_, latent dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRFs) ~ _cite_, time series kernels~ _cite_ and dynamic time-alignment kernels~ _cite_ which have non-linear interactions between the model parameters, ~ _inline_eq_, and the feature representation, ~ _inline_eq_ . There are two central advantages for maintaining a linear relationship between~ _inline_eq_ and~ _inline_eq_ in Equation~ _ref_ . Firstly, the linear form allows one to employ canonical max-margin linear detectors such as linear support vector machines (SVM) ~ _cite_ or structural output SVMs (SO-SVM) ~ _cite_ which generalize well to high-dimensional discriminative learning problems. Secondly, during detector evaluation one can take advantage of efficient search strategies afforded to linear detectors (i.e. linear convolution, summed area tables, etc.) making the application of such detectors highly efficient. Recently, ~ _cite_ demonstrated that state-of-the-art performance in temporal event detection can be achieved using a~ (BOW) representation of the temporal signal in conjunction with a SVM-style detector. Specifically, the authors compared their approach to canonical hidden state probabilistic methods for event detection such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and demonstrated their BOW + SVM method achieves superior performance in terms of computation and accuracy by a considerable margin. A drawback, however, to the BOW representation lies in the destruction of the temporal dynamics in the raw signal, ~ _inline_eq_ . It is the preservation of this temporal ordering information that is at the heart of this paper. We make the following contributions in this paper, We evaluate the proposed approach on three datasets for both isolated and continuous event detection, and demonstrate improved performance while retaining computational efficiency. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section _ref_ presents an overview of existing literature, in particular the bag of words representation, dynamic time warping and time series kernels; Section _ref_ presents our proposed approach and in Section _ref_ we outline the features that we use in the proposed method; Section _ref_ evaluates our proposed approach; and Section _ref_ concludes the paper.
