We propose a method based on deep learning to perform cardiac segmentation on short axis MRI image stacks iteratively from the top slice (around the base) to the bottom slice (around the apex) . At each iteration, a novel variant of U-net is applied to propagate the segmentation of a slice to the adjacent slice below it. In other words, the prediction of a segmentation of a slice is dependent upon the already existing segmentation of an adjacent slice. ND-consistency is hence explicitly enforced. The method is trained on a large database of N cases from UK Biobank. It is then tested on N different cases from UK Biobank and three other state-of-the-art cohorts (ACDC with N cases, Sunnybrook with N cases, RVSC with N cases) . Results comparable or even better than the state-of-the-art in terms of distance measures are achieved. They also emphasize the assets of our method, namely enhanced spatial consistency (currently neither considered nor achieved by the state-of-the-art), and the generalization ability to unseen cases even from other databases.
