Skin lesion segmentation (SLS) in dermoscopic images is a crucial task for automated diagnosis of melanoma. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning SLS model, so-called SLSDeep, which is represented as an encoder-decoder network. The encoder network is constructed by dilated residual layers, in turn, a pyramid pooling network followed by three convolution layers is used for the decoder. Unlike the traditional methods employing a cross-entropy loss, we investigated a loss function by combining both Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) and End Point Error (EPE) to accurately segment the melanoma regions with sharp boundaries. The robustness of the proposed model was evaluated on two public databases: ISBI N and N for skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection challenge. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy. Moreover, it is capable to segment more than _inline_eq_ images of size _inline_eq_ per second on a recent GPU.
