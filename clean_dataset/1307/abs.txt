We present a fully automatic method employing convolutional neural networks based on the ND U-net architecture and random forest classifier to solve the automatic liver lesion segmentation problem of the ISBI N Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) . In order to constrain the ROI in which the tumors could be located, a liver segmentation is performed first. For the organ segmentation an ensemble of convolutional networks is trained to segment a liver using a set of N liver CT datasets from liver surgery planning. Inside of the liver ROI a neural network, trained using N challenge training datasets, identifies tumor candidates, which are subsequently filtered with a random forest classifier yielding the final tumor segmentation. The evaluation on the N challenge test cases resulted in a mean Dice coefficient of N, ranking our method in the second place.
