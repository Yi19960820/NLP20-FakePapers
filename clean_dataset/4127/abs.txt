The approaches for analyzing the polarimetric scattering matrix of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data have always been the focus of PolSAR image classification. Generally, the polarization coherent matrix and the covariance matrix obtained by the polarimetric scattering matrix are used as the main research object to extract features. In this paper, we focus on the original polarimetric scattering matrix and propose a polarimetric scattering coding way to deal with polarimetric scattering matrix and obtain a close complete feature. This encoding mode can also maintain polarimetric information of scattering matrix completely. At the same time, in view of this encoding way, we design a corresponding classification algorithm based on convolution network to combine this feature. Based on polarimetric scattering coding and convolution neural network, the polarimetric convolutional network is proposed to classify PolSAR images by making full use of polarimetric information. We perform the experiments on the PolSAR images acquired by AIRSAR and RADARSAT-N to verify the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method get better results and has huge potential for PolSAR data classification. Source code for polarimetric scattering coding is available at .
