sets---produced by scientific experiments or projects---often contain heterogeneous data obtained by capturing a physical process or object using diverse sensing modalities~ _cite_ . The result is a rich set of signals, heterogeneous in nature but strongly correlated due to their being generated by a common underlying phenomenon. Multi-modal signal processing and analysis is thus gaining momentum in various research disciplines ranging from medical diagnosis _cite_ to remote sensing and computer vision _cite_ . In particular, the analysis of high-resolution multi-modal digital acquisitions of paintings in support of art scholarship has proved a challenging field of research. Examples include the numerical characterization of brushstrokes~ _cite_ for the authentication or dating of paintings, canvas thread counting~ _cite_ with applications in art forensics, and the (semi-) automatic detection and digital inpainting of cracks~ _cite_ . The Lasting Support project has focused on the investigation of the (N), also known as, a polyptych on wood panel painted by Jan and Hubert van Eyck. One of the most admired and influential masterpieces in the history of art, it has given rise to many puzzling questions for art historians. Currently, the is undergoing a major conservation and restoration campaign that is planned to end in N. The panels of the masterpiece were documented with various imaging modalities, amongst which visual macrophotography, infrared macrophotography, infrared reflectography and X-radiography _cite_ . A massive visual data set (comprising over NTB of data) has been compiled by capturing small areas of the polyptych separately and stitching the resulting image blocks into one image per panel _cite_ . X-ray images are common tools in painting investigation, since they reveal information about the composition of the materials, the variations in paint thickness, the support as well as the cracks and losses in the ground and paint layers. The problem we address in this paper relates to the outer side panels, namely, the panels showing near life-sized depictions of Adam and Eve, shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . Due to X-ray penetration, the scans of these panels are a mixture of the paintings from each side of the panel as well as the wood panel itself. The presence of all these components makes the reading of the X-ray image difficult for art experts, who would welcome an effective approach to separate the components. The task of separating a mixture of signals into its constituent components is a popular field of research. Most work addresses the blind source separation (BSS) problem, where the goal is to retrieve the different sources from a given linear mixture. Several methods attempt to solve the BSS \problem by imposing constraints on the sources' structure. Independent component analysis (ICA) _cite_ commonly assumes that the components are independent non-Gaussian and attempts to separate them by minimizing the mutual information _cite_ . Nonnegative matrix factorization is another approach to solve the problem, where it is assumed that the sources are nonnegative (or they are transformed to a nonnegative representation) _cite_ . In an alternative path, the problem has been cast into a Bayesian framework, where either the sources are viewed as latent variables _cite_, or the problem is solved by maximizing the joint posterior density of the sources _cite_ . Under the Bayesian methodology, spatial smoothing priors (via, for example, Markov random fields) have been used to regularize blind image separation problems _cite_ . These assumptions do not fit our particular problem as both components have similar statistical properties and they are certainly not statistically independent. Sparsity is another source prior heavily exploited in BSS _cite_, as well as in various other inverse problems, such as, compressed sensing _cite_, image inpainting _cite_, denoising _cite_, and deconvolution _cite_ . Morphological component analysis (MCA), in particular, is a state-of-the-art sparsity-based regularization method, initially designed for the single-mixture problem _cite_ and then extended to the multi-mixture case _cite_ . The crux of the method is the basic assumption that each component has its own characteristic morphology; namely, each has a highly sparse representation over a set of bases (or, dictionaries), while being highly non-sparse for the dictionaries of the other components. Prior work in digital painting analysis has employed MCA to remove cradling artifacts within X-ray images of paintings on a panel~ _cite_ . The cradling and painting components have very different morphologies, captured by different predefined dictionaries. Namely, complex wavelets _cite_ provide a sparse representation for the smooth X-ray image and shearlets _cite_ were used to represent the texture of the wood grain. Alternatively, dictionaries can be learned from a set of training signals; several algorithms have been proposed to construct dictionaries including the method of optimal directions (MOD) _cite_ and the K-SVD algorithm _cite_ . Both utilize the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) ~ _cite_ method for sparse decomposition but they differ in the way they update the dictionary elements while learning. Recently, multi-mixture MCA has been combined with K-SVD, resulting in a method where dictionaries are learned adaptively while separating _cite_ . However, in our particular separation problem we have a simple mixture of two X-ray components that are morphologically very similar [see Fig. _ref_] . Hence, as we will show in the experimental section, simply using fixed or learned dictionaries is insufficient to discriminate one component from the other. Unlike prior work, in our setup we have access to high-quality photographic material from each side of the panel that can be used to assist the X-ray image separation process. In this work, we elaborate on a novel method to perform separation of X-ray images from a single mixture by using images of another modality as side information. Our contributions are as follows: In the remainder of the paper: Section _ref_ reviews related work and Section _ref_ poses our source separation with side information problem.
