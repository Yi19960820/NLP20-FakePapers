Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) is a commonly-used methodology to identify the presence of Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) which facilitates the diagnosis of various autoimmune diseases. Until now, this diagnostic process is performed by specialist's observing under a fluorescence microscope and it relies heavily on the experience and expertise of the physicians. Manual identification of these staining patterns suffers from intrinsic limitations related to visual evaluation by humans~ _cite_ . Thus, automatic pattern classification by computer vision techniques has been increasingly demanded. During the past four years, various computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems have been designed with image analysis techniques in several classification challenges held by ICPR and ICIP~ _cite_ . Current research in this topic is in its early age and there is still room for improvement, especially for deep learning methods. Due to the variations between patients and the photo-bleaching effect caused by the light source~ _cite_, the variations between separated specimens in same class/pattern are often large. As shown in Figure~ _ref_, some patterns could be easily misidentified (i.e., vs), indicating the inter-class variations on certain occasions are small. The existing shallow methods to address this problem mainly focus on three main separated aspects: handcrafting features, (sparse) coding and classification. Each of those components has been well studied; for instance, the winner of ICPR N Classification Contest~ _cite_ utilized multiple types of local descriptors with multi-resolution combining with sparse coding and ensemble SVMs. For these systems, hand-crafted features in feature-extraction stage, as well as parameter selection in feature-coding stage, rely much on empirical selection. Very recently, deep learning methods, such as CNNs~ _cite_, have been initially applied to HEp-N cells classification~ _cite_ . However, there are some key issues that have not been investigated: i) cross-specimen evaluation of CNNs model and ii) the key factors in adopting deep CNNs for cell image classification. It is important to note that the first issue is crucial to the evaluation of systems expected to be robust to different patients or specimens. Thus it is particularly valuable for HEp-N cells computer-assisted diagnosis system. In this paper, we propose a new deep convolutional architecture and evaluated our system on public dataset released by ICPR~N~Contest~ _cite_ . Experimental result shows the our framework is effective and slightly outperforms another CNN-based system. More importantly, we investigate further into the effect of different compositions of training set on deep model. We find that data augmentation by adding new specimens are much more beneficial to overall performance than by employing affine transformations alone, which has been investigated in~ _cite_ .
