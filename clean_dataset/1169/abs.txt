Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used over many areas in compute vision. Especially in classification. Recently, FlowNet and several works on optical estimation using CNNs shows the potential ability of CNNs in doing per-pixel regression. We proposed several CNNs network architectures that can estimate optical flow, and fully unveiled the intrinsic different between these structures.
