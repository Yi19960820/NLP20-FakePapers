Bird species are recognized as useful biodiversity indicators. They are responsive to changes in sensitive ecosystems, whilst populations-level changes in behavior are both visible and quantifiable. Suffered from great species variation, it is difficult for non-professionals to identify the sub-category of a bird only by its appearance. However, it is exhausting to annotate all the images by human beings with expert knowledge. Thus, an automatic classification system for bird species are needed, which will be great convenience for many practical applications. For researchers working outdoors, shoot photos can be classified and analyzed immediately by the system, illustration books are no more needed. For the public, the system could provide much fun when combined with culture information like poems and legends. It will arouse peopleâ€™s interest in birds and could benefit the protections of birds. Apart from that, Classifying bird species is an interesting problem for Fine-grained categorization, also known as subcategory recognition, which is a subfield in object recognition. In recent years, fine-grained classification stood out from basic-level classification, bringing promising applications and new challenges to computer vision society. In this Bird Species Classification Challenge, our main focus was to classify birds from high resolution photographs taken from camera. In this task, to improve classification task, we have also provided localization of birds in the respective images with their class labels. The Main Challenges involving in this problem are given below. We have proposed a end to end deep learning based approach using transfer learning to learn both micro and macro level features from Bird ROIs. We have used pre-trained Mask-RCNN to get the Bird ROIs from the images and used Multistage training method to remove class imbalance partially \& boost up the accuracy of our model. Further information about model is given in the respective section.
