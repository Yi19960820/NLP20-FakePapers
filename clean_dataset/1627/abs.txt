This work presents EddyNet, a deep learning based architecture for automated eddy detection and classification from Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps provided by the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) . EddyNet consists of a convolutional encoder-decoder followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The output is a map with the same size of the input where pixels have the following labels . Keras Python code, the training datasets and EddyNet weights files are open-source and freely available on _url_ .
