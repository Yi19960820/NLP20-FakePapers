neural networks have shown promising results in a wide range of applications including image segmentation. Recent medical image processing literature shows significant progress towards automatic segmentation of brain lesions _cite_, tumors _cite_, and neuroanatomy _cite_ using ND networks _cite_, and more recently using ND network architectures _cite_ . Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with skip connections, in particular, have shown great performance _cite_ . A comprehensive review of the rapidly growing literature on the broad subject of medical image segmentation requires stand-alone review papers and is beyond the scope of this article; however, after this brief introduction, we review the most relevant literature that motivated this work or is directly connected or comparable to this work in Section~ _ref_ . In this work we focus on semantic segmentation of unbalanced imaging data using deep learning, where we consider automatic brain lesion segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as a benchmark application. MS is the most common disabling neurologic autoimmune disease resulting from recurrent attacks of inflammation in the central nervous system _cite_ . Across the extensive literature for automated MS lesion segmentation, there are methods that try to alleviate the data imbalance issue by equal selection of training samples from each class _cite_, whereas others propose using more persistent loss functions _cite_ . To deal with significantly unbalanced imaging data we present two main contributions in this work. First, we propose an asymmetric loss function based on the Tversky index (_inline_eq_ scores) and compare its generality and performance to the Dice similarity loss function recently proposed for medical image segmentation using FCNs~ _cite_, the generalized Dice loss (GDL) function~ _cite_, and the focal loss~ _cite_ all proposed to deal with unbalanced data. Second, we proposed using large patches (as opposed to the whole image as input) that lead to relatively higher ratio of lesion versus non-lesion samples. Overlapping patches provide intrinsic data augmentation, make a better balance in data for training, and make the network adaptable for any size inputs with efficient memory usage. Despite their advantages, patches have limited effective receptive fields, therefore we propose a patch prediction fusion strategy to take into account the prediction uncertainty in patch borders. In what follows, we review the state-of-the-art in MS lesion segmentation and the related work that motivated this study. Then we show two network architectures trained with asymmetric loss functions that generate accurate lesion segmentation in ongoing MS lesion challenges and compared to the literature according to several performance metrics.
