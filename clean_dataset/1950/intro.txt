Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical scans is of high interest in current clinical practice as it plays an important role in many tasks involved in computer-aided diagnosis, image-guided interventions, radiotherapy and radiology. In particular, quantitative diagnostics requires accurate boundaries of anatomical organs. Computed tomography (CT) is currently among the most used ND imaging modalities. Despite its inability of differentiating organs with similar intensities it is widely used for diagnosis of diseases in organs. Manual segmentation in CT can be a very tedious task. Therefore, automated methods with minor or no human interaction at all, are preferable. Automated segmentation with deep learning methods in medical images has popularized widely in the recent years, mainly due to the success of applying in natural images~ _cite_ and consequently in the biomedical imaging~ _cite_ . Since then various modifications of s have been proposed for segmentation of different anatomical organs and imaging modalities. ND scans are generally represented as stacks of ND images. Running a segmentation algorithm on the ND slices directly with merging results afterwards ignores spatial inter-slice correlations, therefore hybrid ND/ND and direct ND approaches gained popularity. Most of these methods are built upon ND~ _cite_ and ND~ _cite_ U-Net architectures. Lu et al.~ _cite_ proposed to locate and segment the liver via convolutional neural networks and graph cuts. Dou et al. _cite_ presented a ND which boosts liver segmentation accuracy by deep supervision layers. Yang et al. _cite_ used adversarial training in order to gain in performance for the ND U-Net segmentation of the liver in CT scans. Sekuboyina et al.~ _cite_ proposed a pipeline approach for both localization and segmentation of the spine in CT. Here the vertebrae segmentation is performed in a blockwise manner to overcome memory limitations as well as obtain a fine-grained result. A similar blockwise approach in combination with a multi-scale two-way was introduced by Korez et al.~ _cite_ . Other noteworthy works using variants of ND and ND U-Nets consider applications in cardiac MR image segmentation~ _cite_, pancreas in ND CT~ _cite_ and prostate in ND MR~ _cite_ . A variety of papers have contributed to the multiple tasks in brain imaging such as segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter~ _cite_, brain tumour~ _cite_, multiple sclerosis lesion~ _cite_ and glioblastoma~ _cite_ . In order to overcome memory limitations modern-based methods are usually preceded by downsampling of the input scans. This might result in a deformation of organs in the image, causing information loss. Consequently, hybrid ND/ND methods that process volumetric data in a slice-wise fashion followed by a ND processing step, gained importance. For instance, Li et al.~ _cite_ applied a slice-wise densely connected variant of the ND U-Net architecture for liver segmentation first, and refined the result by the auto-context algorithm in ND. For the same task, Christ et al.~ _cite_ applied slice-wise ND U-Nets to obtain a rough segmentation first, and then tuned the result in a second step with Conditional Random Fields. Relying only on intra-slice data is insufficient for proper leveraging spatial information. In order to address this issue, the above-mentioned methods applied computationally expensive ND classical image processing refinement strategies in addition to the ND-based approach. Hybrid approaches combining with recurrent networks such as ~ _cite_ and more recently proposed ~ _cite_ are effective for processing sequential data in general. Hence, the recurrent networks have recently been introduced to the biomedical imaging context. A method proposed by Poudel et al.~ _cite_ uses a U-Net variant to get an estimate of the ND slice-wise segmentation, which is subsequently refined by the so-called gated recurrent unit~ _cite_, a simplified version of the . Bates et al.~ _cite_ evaluated several architectures involving both and standard convolutional layers. In the deep configuration, several bidirectional units were stacked in the U-shaped architecture in which the outputs of the forward and backward passes were concatenated. In the shallow configuration a shared copy of the CNN was applied to each slice of the ND scans separately and then the result was passed to the stacked units to produce the segmentation volume. For the purpose of designing a multi-scale architecture, Chen et al.~ _cite_ used a variant of ND U-Net to extract features for all slices first, and then processed them with bidirectional units in order to exploit ND context. Though the described approaches address some issues of the deep learning based ND segmentation algorithms such as voxel size anisotropy and intensive computations due to ND convolutions, they still do not take into account the two following issues. First, they require that all volumes have the same fixed input reference dimensions, and, second, all slices of the volumes have to be available in order to extract ND context at both training and testing time. The former scenario is not always applicable usually due to large variations of the number of slices in the volumes across even the same dataset, and the latter one could force reducing network capacity due to memory and timing restrictions what could potentially lead to lower accuracies. To overcome these problems we propose to integrate bidirectional s into a U-Net-like architecture in order to extract the ND context of slices in a sequential manner. In this way, the network is able to learn the inter-slice correlations based on the slabs of the volume. The downsampling of the input is not required anymore as only a fraction of the volume is processed at any given time. Training of this network is therefore not demanding memory-wise which is another known limitation of the current modern networks. This fully integrated sequential approach can be particularly useful for real-time applications as it enables segmentation already during data acquisition or while loading the data as both are generally performed slice-by-slice. Furthermore, we show the invariance of our method to field-of-view and orientation by evaluating on two CT datasets depicting two different organs, namely liver and vertebrae. For the sake of simplicity of the further explanation in the following we refer to this architecture as (acronym for "sequential segmentation of organs in ND") .
