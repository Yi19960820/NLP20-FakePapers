The compressed sensing theory~ _cite_ shows that if a signal is sparse in a certain domain _inline_eq_, it can be accurately recovered from a small number of random linear measurements less than that of Nyquist sampling theorem. Mathematically, the measurements are obtained by the following linear transformation where _inline_eq_ is the signal, _inline_eq_ is known as the measurement vector, _inline_eq_ is the measurement matrix and _inline_eq_ denotes noise. If _inline_eq_, reconstructing _inline_eq_ from _inline_eq_ is generally ill-posed, which is one of the most challenging issues in compressed sensing. To design an efficient CS reconstruction algorithm, many methods have been proposed, which can be generally divided into two categories: traditional optimization-based methods and recent DNN-based methods. In the optimization-based reconstruction methods, given the linear projections _inline_eq_, the original image _inline_eq_ can be reconstructed by solving the following convex optimization problem~ _cite_: To solve this convex problem, many algorithms have been proposed~ _cite_ . However, these algorithms suffer from uncertain reconstruction qualities and high computation cost, which inevitably limit their applications in practice. Recently, some DNN-based algorithms have been proposed for image CS reconstruction. In~ _cite_, Mousavi et al. propose to utilize a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) to reconstruct original images from their measurements. A series of convolutional layers are adopted in~ _cite_ for image reconstruction. Despite their impressive results, massive block artifacts and ringing effects are delivered at low sampling ratios. To overcome the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods, we propose a Laplacian Pyramid based deep architecture for CS reconstruction. Our network contains two sub-networks: sampling sub-network and reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, a convolutional layer with the kernel size of _inline_eq_ (_inline_eq_ is the size of current block) is utilized to mimic the sampling process. In the reconstruction sub-network, we use two branches to reconstruct multi-scale residual features and multi-scale target images progressively through Laplacian pyramid architectures. Besides, the second branch integrates multi-scale information from the first branch to preserve finer textures. The sampling sub-network and reconstruction sub-network are optimized jointly with the robust Charbonnier loss~ _cite_ .
