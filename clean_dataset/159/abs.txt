We present a single network method for panoptic segmentation. This method combines the predictions from a jointly trained semantic and instance segmentation network using heuristics. Joint training is the first step towards an end-to-end panoptic segmentation network and is faster and more memory efficient than training and predicting with two networks, as done in previous work. The architecture consists of a ResNet-N feature extractor shared by the semantic segmentation and instance segmentation branch. For instance segmentation, a Mask R-CNN type of architecture is used, while the semantic segmentation branch is augmented with a Pyramid Pooling Module. Results for this method are submitted to the COCO and Mapillary Joint Recognition Challenge N. Our approach achieves a PQ score of N on the Mapillary Vistas validation set and N on the COCO test-dev set.
