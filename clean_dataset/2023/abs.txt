We present a convolutional approach to reflection symmetry detection in ND. Our model, built on the products of complex-valued wavelet convolutions, simplifies previous edge-based pairwise methods. Being parameter-centered, as opposed to feature-centered, it has certain computational advantages when the object sizes are known a priori, as demonstrated in an ellipse detection application. The method outperforms the best-performing algorithm on the CVPR N Symmetry Detection Competition Database in the single-symmetry case. Code and a new database for ND symmetry detection is available.
