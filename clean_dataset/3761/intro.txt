Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology _cite_, neurology _cite_ and cardiology _cite_, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside the tissue through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. Though PET has high sensitivity compared with other imaging modalities, its image resolution and signal to noise ratio (SNR) are still low due to various physical degradation factors and low coincident-photon counts detected. Improving PET image quality is essential, especially in applications like small lesion detection, brain imaging and longitudinal studies. Over the past decades, multiple advances have been made in PET system instrumentation, such as exploiting time of flight (TOF) information _cite_, enabling depth of interaction capability _cite_ and extending the solid angle coverage _cite_ . With the wide adoption of iterative reconstruction in clinical scanners, more accurate point spread function (PSF) modeling can be used to take various degradation factors into consideration _cite_ . In addition, various post processing approaches and iterative reconstruction methods have been developed by making use of local patch statistics, prior anatomical or temporal information. Denoising methods, such as the HYPR processing _cite_, non-local mean denoising _cite_ and guided image filtering _cite_ have been developed and show better performance in bias-variance tradeoff or partial volume correction than the conventional Gaussian filtering. In regularized image reconstruction, entropy or mutual information based methods _cite_, segmentation based methods _cite_, and gradient based methods _cite_ have been developed by penalizing the difference between the reconstructed image and the prior information in specific domains. The Bowsher's method _cite_ adjusts the weight of the penalty based on similarity metrics calculated from prior images. Methods based on sparse representations _cite_, have also shown better image qualities in both static and dynamic reconstructions. Most of the aforementioned methods require prior information from the same patient which is not always available due to instrumentation limitation or long scanning time, which may hamper the practical application of these methods. Recently a new method is developed to use information in longitudinal scans _cite_, but can only be applied to specific studies. In this paper, we explore the potential of using existing inter-patient information via deep neural network to improve PET image reconstruction. Over the past several years, deep neural networks have been widely and successfully applied to computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation _cite_, object detection _cite_ and image super resolution _cite_, due to the availability of large data sets, advances in optimization algorithms and emerging of effective network structures. Recently, it has been applied to medical imaging, such as image denoising and artifact reduction, using convolutional neural network (CNN) _cite_ or generative adversarial network (GAN) _cite_ . It showed comparable or superior results to the iterative reconstruction but at a faster speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework to integrate deep CNN in PET image reconstruction. The network structure is a combination of U-net structure _cite_ and the residual network _cite_ . Different from existing CNN based image denoising methods, we use a CNN trained with iterative reconstructions of low-counts data as the input and high-counts reconstructions as the label to represent the unknown PET image to be reconstructed. Rather than feeding a noisy image into the CNN, we use the CNN to define the feasible set of valid PET images. To our knowledge, this is the first of its kind in the applications of neural network in medical imaging. The solution is formulated as the solution of a constrained optimization problem and sought by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm _cite_ . The proposed method is validated using both simulation and hybrid real data. The main contributions of this paper include (N) using dynamic data of prior patients to train a network for PET denoising and (N) proposing to incorporate the neural network into the iterative reconstruction framework and demonstrating better performance than the denoising approach. This paper is organized as follows. Section N introduces the theory and optimization algorithm. Section N describes the Monte Carlo simulations and real data used in the evaluation. Experimental results are shown in Section N, followed by discussions in Section N. Finally conclusions are drawn in Section N.
