With the proliferation of social media, fashion inspired from celebrities, reputed designers as well as fashion influencers has shortned the cycle of fashion design and manufacturing. However, with the explosion of fashion related content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an arduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and create a digest of trending fashion. Designers do not just wish to have fashion related photos at one place but seek search functionalities that can let them search photos with natural language queries such as `red dress', 'vintage handbags', etc in order to spot the trends. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion photos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a given fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have thousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult to get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover, state-of-the-art object detectors~ _cite_ do not have any functionality to ingest large amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic object detector~ _cite_, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on N categories from recently released Open Images VN dataset. We first train the base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on NK unlabeled photos from N categories gathered from social media, and then subsequently fine tune it on N labeled photos from Open Images VN dataset. On _inline_eq_ image inputs, we achieve N \% mAP on a test dataset of N photos while performing N \% to N \% better as compared to the state-of-the-art object detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of architecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs significantly better in identifying small objects.
