There has been a growing interest in using different approaches to improve the coding efficiency of modern video codec in recent years as demand for web-based video consumption increases. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach that uses texture analysis/synthesis to reconstruct blocks in texture regions of a video to achieve potential coding gains using the AVN codec developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) . The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks to extract texture regions in a frame, which are then reconstructed using a global motion model. Our preliminary results show an increase in coding efficiency while maintaining satisfactory visual quality.
