The formation of star clusters is one of the most important events strictly related with the internal evolution of galaxies. Massive stars are responsible for the global ionization of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) . About half of the mass in the ISM of a Galaxy is mainly derived by Molecular Clouds (MC) formed by stars. In such formation scenarios turbulent dynamics produce filamentary structures, where the total amount per unit area of suspended material measured along the length of a column (hereafter column density) agglomerates material from the Interstellar radiation field _cite_ . As a natural consequence of the cooling process and gravitational instability, the filaments are fragmented into chains of turbulent clumps which may engage the process of star formation. Therefore, the knowledge about the morphology of such filamentary structures is a crucial information to understand the star formation process. The traditional method, which represents our starting point in the design and application of the presented methodology, carries out filaments detection by thresholding over the image of the multi-directional Nnd derivatives of the signal to identify the spine, the area and the underlying background of the filaments, automatically identifying nodal points and filament branches _cite_ . From the extracted regions of detected filaments it is possible to estimate several physical parameters of the filament such as the width, length, mean column density and mass per unit length. In the present work we present a preliminary study of a data mining tool designed to improve the shape definition of filamentary structures extracted by the traditional method. This study is included into the EU FPN project ViaLactea, aimed at exploiting the combination of new-generation Infrared-Radio surveys of the Galactic Plane from space missions and ground-based facilities, by making an extensive use of ND visual analysis and data mining for the data and science analysis, _cite_ .
