Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many problems in Document Image Analysis. These areas include whole image classification~ _cite_, image preprocessing~ _cite_, script identification~ _cite_, and character recognition~ _cite_ . The success of CNNs has been attributed to their ability to learn features in an end-to-end fashion from large quantities of labeled data. In this work, we present a simple CNN based framework for classifying page images or text lines into font classes. Handling multiple fonts is a challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), as the OCR system must handle large variations in character appearance due to differences in font. If text lines are labeled with a font class, then a specialist OCR system for that font can potentially achieve higher recognition rates than an OCR system trained on many fonts~ _cite_ . In this framework, a CNN is trained to classify small image patches into font classes. At prediction time, we densely extract patches from the test image and average font predictions over individual patch predictions. Although this method is simple, we achieve N \% text line accuracy on the King Fahd University Arabic Font Database (KAFD) for N type faces in N styles and N different sizes~ _cite_ . The best previous result is N \% on a subset of N type faces~ _cite_ . We also demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with N \% accuracy on the Classification of Latin Medival Manuscripts (CLaMM) dataset, where the highest previously reported accuracy is N \%~ _cite_ . In addition to showing that CNNs perform well at font classification tasks, we perform an in-depth analysis of the features learned by the CNN. Though CNNs are black box models, we can gain an understanding of what features are used for classification by measuring output responses as we vary characteristics of the input images. Such an analysis can demonstrate whether the CNN is overfitting to nuisance factors of the collection of documents it was trained on. For example, the CLaMM dataset contains N scribal script classes defined by expert paleographers that are handwriting styles that differ in character allographs and morphological shape~ _cite_ . However, we find that CNNs trained on CLaMM are sensitive to how dark the text is. This is undesirable because the CNN may be applied to novel document collections that have a different bias w.r.t. text darkness. We provide a solution to this problem using a new form of data augmentation, which also improves performance on CLaMM. We also find that CNNs can be sensitive to other factors such as inter-line spacing and presence of non-textual content.
