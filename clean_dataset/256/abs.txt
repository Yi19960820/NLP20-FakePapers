Most existing video summarisation methods are based on either supervised or unsupervised learning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based weakly supervised method that exploits easy-to-obtain, video-level category labels and encourages summaries to contain category-related information and maintain category recognisability. Specifically, We formulate video summarisation as a sequential decision-making process and train a summarisation network with deep Q-learning (DQSN) . A companion classification network is also trained to provide rewards for training the DQSN. With the classification network, we develop a global recognisability reward based on the classification result. Critically, a novel {\it dense} ranking-based reward is also proposed in order to cope with the temporally delayed and sparse reward problems for long sequence reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.
