Sparse representation models a signal as a linear combination of a small number of dictionary atoms. As a generative model, it requires the dictionary to be highly redundant in order to ensure both a stable high sparsity level and a low reconstruction error for the signal. However, in practice, this requirement is usually impaired by the lack of labelled training samples. Fortunately, previous research has shown that the requirement for a redundant dictionary can be less rigorous if simultaneous sparse approximation is employed, which can be carried out by enforcing various structured sparsity constraints on the sparse codes of the neighboring pixels. In addition, numerous works have shown that applying a variety of dictionary learning methods for the sparse representation model can also improve the classification performance. In this paper, we highlight the task-driven dictionary learning algorithm, which is a general framework for the supervised dictionary learning method. We propose to enforce structured sparsity priors on the task-driven dictionary learning method in order to improve the performance of the hyperspectral classification. Our approach is able to benefit from both the advantages of the simultaneous sparse representation and those of the supervised dictionary learning. We enforce two different structured sparsity priors, the joint and Laplacian sparsity, on the task-driven dictionary learning method and provide the details of the corresponding optimization algorithms. Experiments on numerous popular hyperspectral images demonstrate that the classification performance of our approach is superior to sparse representation classifier with structured priors or the task-driven dictionary learning method.
