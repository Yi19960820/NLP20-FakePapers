While image and video compression for consumer grade cameras have been in use since early N's, it was more than two decades later, with the advent of television and telconferencing, that medical images started being compressed. Availability of digital X-ray detector, development of full-scale digital imaging systems, deployment of teleradiology networks for screening, life long archival of medical images for pathology modeling and personalized medicine were few of the factors that inspired early research on medical image compression in N's. These were deployed a decade later~ _cite_ for addressing the challenges faced by clinical establishments. Hospitals typically accumulate about NTB of imaging data per year, and with the growing trend towards personalized medicine necessitating life long archival, it inspires development of high-density medical image compression at factors _inline_eq_ achieving _inline_eq_ bpp with no loss of visual features relevant for diagnosis. Our method in Fig.~ _ref_ is inspired by recent developments in deep learning based compression techniques for camera images~ _cite_ and experimentally rivals JPEG ~ _cite_ as well as the reigning standard JPEGN ~ _cite_ at such demands of high compression factors, validated with experiments performed using X-ray mammograms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Prior art is discussed in Sec. N. Sec. N describes the fully convolutional autoencoder (CAE) based compression engine for mammograms. The experiments performed for evaluation and benchmarking of performance of our approach vs. JPEG and JPEGN are described in Sec. N and characteristic aspects along with clinical usability study is discussed in Sec. N, finally concluding the work in Sec. N.
