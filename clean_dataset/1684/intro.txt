Since the AlexNet~ _cite_ sparked off the passion for research on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNNs have been improving the performance of image classification continuously. And heterogeneous successive brilliant CNN models lead this wave with compelling results, besides, state of the art of various vision tasks, such as detection~ _cite_ and segmentation~ _cite_, is advancing rapidly leveraging the power of CNN. A number of recent papers~ _cite_ have tried to lend insights on the interpretability of CNN. These methods focus on understanding CNN by visualizing the learned representations. An interesting conclusion~ _cite_ has been drawn that CNN has the ability to localize objects without any supervision in classification task. As shown in Figure~ _ref_, we visualize the VGGN using Grad-CAM~ _cite_ . We posit that single network may not notice all informative regions or details which leads to misclassification as exhibited in Figure~ _ref_ . Based on this point, in this paper we propose a parallel networks architecture dubbed D-PCN, which coordinates parallel networks to focus on different regions and learn complementary features under the guide of a discriminator. The D-PCN is depicted in Figure~ _ref_ . The final prediction is reported by the extra classifier. We adopt a training method which is modified from adversarial learning to achieve our goal. We implement D-PCN on CIFAR-N~ _cite_ and ImageNetNxN~ _cite_ datasets with NIN~ _cite_, ResNet~ _cite_, WRN~ _cite_, ResNeXt~ _cite_ and DenseNet~ _cite_ . In experiments, the performance of D-PCN ascends greatly compared with single base CNN. In particular, our method has outperformed all advanced related approaches which use multiple subnetworks on CIFAR-N. We also apply Grad-CAM~ _cite_ to visualize D-PCN with VGGN~ _cite_ on a fine-grained classification dataset, Stanford Dogs~ _cite_, and the result verifies our motivation. In addition, we introduce D-PCN into FCN~ _cite_ on PASCAL VOC N segmentation task, and experiment result demonstrates that D-PCN can also improve accuracy of segmentation. And an arresting thing occurs in segmentation experiment, that is the degree of convergence for both parallel networks rises significantly. We summarize our contributions as follows:
