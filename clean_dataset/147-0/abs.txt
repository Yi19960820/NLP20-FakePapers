This paper proposes a multi-level feature learning framework for human action recognition using a single body-worn inertial sensor. The framework consists of three phases, respectively designed to analyze signal-based (low-level), components (mid-level) and semantic (high-level) information. Low-level features capture the time and frequency domain property while mid-level representations learn the composition of the action. The Max-margin Latent Pattern Learning (MLPL) method is proposed to learn high-level semantic descriptions of latent action patterns as the output of our framework. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances, N \%, N \% and N \% (weighted _inline_eq_ score) respectively, on Skoda, WISDM and OPP datasets.
