Face alignment is the problem of localizing a set of facial landmarks in ND images. It is a well-studied problem in Computer Vision research, yet most of prior work _cite_, datasets _cite_ and challenges _cite_ have focused on frontal images. However, under a totally unconstrained scenario, faces might be in arbitrary poses. To address this limitation of prior work, recently, a few methods have been proposed for large pose face alignment _cite_ . ND face alignment goes one step further by treating the face as a full ND object and attempting to localize the facial landmarks in ND space. To boost research in ND face alignment, the Nst Workshop on ND Face Alignment in the Wild (NDFAW) \& Challenge is organized in conjunction with ECCV N _cite_ . In this paper, we describe a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for ND face alignment, that ranked Nst in the NDFAW Challenge, surpassing the second best result by more than N \%. Our method is a CNN cascade consisting of three connected subnetworks, all learned via residual learning _cite_ . See Fig. _ref_ . The first two subnetworks perform residual part heatmap regression _cite_ for estimating the X, Y coordinates of the facial landmarks. As in _cite_, the first subnetwork is a part detection network trained to detect the individual facial landmarks using a per-pixel softmax loss. The output of this subnetwork is a set of N landmark detection heatmaps. The second subnetwork is a regression subnetwork that jointly regresses the landmark detection heatmaps stacked with image features to confidence maps representing the location of the landmarks. Then, on top of the first two subnetworks, we added a third very deep subnetwork that estimates the Z coordinate of each fiducial point. The newly introduced network is guided by the heatmaps produced by the ND regression subnetwork and subsequently learns where to ``look'' by explicitly exploiting information about the ND location of the landmarks. We show that the proposed method produces remarkable fitting results for both X, Y and Z coordinates, securing the first place on the NDFAW Challenge. This paper is organized as follows: section _ref_ describes our system in detail. Section _ref_ describes the experiments performed and our results on the NDFAW dataset. Finally, section _ref_ summarizes our contributions and concludes the paper.
