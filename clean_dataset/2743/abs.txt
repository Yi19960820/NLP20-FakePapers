We present a simple dynamic batching approach applicable to a large class of dynamic architectures that consistently yields speedups of over Nx. We provide performance bounds when the architecture is not known a priori and a stronger bound in the special case where the architecture is a predetermined balanced tree. We evaluate our approach on Johnson et al.'s recent visual question answering (VQA) result of his CLEVR dataset by Inferring and Executing Programs (IEP) . We also evaluate on sparsely gated mixture of experts layers and achieve speedups of up to Nx over the naive implementation.
