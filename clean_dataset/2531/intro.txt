Machine learning methods have been applied to deal with various multi-media and computer vision tasks. Traditionally, linear models such as sparse representation (SR) _cite_ and collaborative representation (CR) _cite_ have drawn much attention and gained promising results in image classification. Lately, nonlinear deep learning _cite_ models, e.g., ResNet _cite_ and VGG _cite_, have produced state-of-the-art results in many image-based tasks, including face recognition, object detection, video tracking, etc. Linear sparse models can be utilized to improve deep neural networks _cite_ . On the other hand, more and more conventional methods took deep features as input to gain more promising classification results _cite_ . However, recent studies showed that deep features from neural networks are usually designed for SVM-like classifiers _cite_ . Using deep features as sole input in non-SVM classical models could be dubious. For this problem, we believe that the technique of linearly representing images can be applied to enhance nonlinear deep models. Deep learning shows a very strong capacity to learn discriminative image features. CNN features off-the-shelf _cite_ were demonstrated to be powerful for recognition tasks. Learning deep features can help to obtain state-of-the-art results for different tasks like face recognition _cite_, scene recognition _cite_, person re-identification _cite_ and general image classification _cite_ . The good news is that many conventional machine learning methods can also learn credible features from images. In recent years, Sparse Representation (SR) _cite_ via _inline_eq_ regularization has shown huge potential in feature extraction and image classification. On the other hand, _inline_eq_ regularization-based Collaborative Representation (CR) _cite_ can also build a similarly robust linear model. The _inline_eq_ regularization inside CR helps to create an equally discriminative but faster sparse representation _cite_ . According to our observation, sparseness plays an important role in both linear and nonlinear models. It is likely for these two paradigms, deep and classic representations, to generate a new representation learning model when collaborating with each other. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Weight-based Classification method that brings deep and classic non-deep representation together, to implement a more promising image classification. We name it DeepCWC for short. The contribution of this work includes: N) proposing a new classifier to integrate features from linear and nonlinear models, N) giving an analysis on how black-box deep features work in a sparse classification model, N) conducting image classification experiments on different CNN models and convolutional layers inside them, to demonstrate the performance of DeepCWC in a consistent and comprehensive way. The proposed method produces promising results on face and object recognition. In particular, it ranks first in recognition (N \%) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
