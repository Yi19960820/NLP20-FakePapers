Make, model and color recognition (MMCR) of vehicles _cite_ is of great interest in several applications such as law-enforcement, driver assistance, surveillance and traffic monitoring. This fine-grained visual classification task _cite_ has been traditionally a difficult task for computers. The main challenge is the subtle differences between classes (e.g BMW N series and BMW N series) compared to some traditional classification tasks such as ImageNet. Recently, there have been efforts to design more accurate algorithms for MMCR such as those in the works of Sochor et al in _cite_ and Hsieh et al _cite_ . Moreover, many researchers have focused on collecting large datasets to facilitate research in this area _cite_ . However, the complexity of current methods and/or the small size of current datasets lead to sub-optimal performance in real world use cases. Thus, there are still considerable short-comings for agencies or commercial entities looking to deploy reliable software for the task of MMCR. In this paper, we present a system that is capable of detecting and tagging the make, model and color of vehicles irrespective of viewing angle with high accuracy. Our model is trained to recognize _inline_eq_ different vehicle makes as well as _inline_eq_ different models in what we believe is the largest set available for commercial or non commercial use. The contributions of Sighthound's vehicle MMCR system are listed as follows:
