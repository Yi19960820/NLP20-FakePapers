While there has been a success in ND human pose estimation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ND human pose estimation has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we tackle the ND human pose estimation task with end-to-end learning using CNNs. Relative ND positions between one joint and the other joints are learned via CNNs. The proposed method improves the performance of CNN with two novel ideas. First, we added ND pose information to estimate a ND pose from an image by concatenating ND pose estimation result with the features from an image. Second, we have found that more accurate ND poses are obtained by combining information on relative positions with respect to multiple joints, instead of just one root joint. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on Human N dataset.
