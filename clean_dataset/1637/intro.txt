Cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease (CHD), is one of the leading cause of death in the western world _cite_ . It has been demonstrated that including coronary artery calcium score in traditional risk factors, results in a significant improvement in the classification of risk for the prediction of CHD events _cite_ . Usually, in clinical practice coronary calcium is manually detected by expert operators on ECG-triggered non-contrast enhanced CT images, i.e. without the use of contrast medium, with the aid of semi-automatic software. Typically, the identified lesions are characterized by intensity values above a standard threshold of N HU and belonging to coronary artery's structures. Subsequently, on the basis of all detected objects, the Agatston score _cite_ is computed with the aim of defining the corresponding cardiac risk. Even though this manual approach represents the clinical standard, it remains a time-consuming and operator dependent task. In recent years a remarkable progress has been made in automatic image recognition, primarily due to a class of deep learning algorithms namely convolutional neural networks _cite_ (CNNs or ConvNets), which have shown great performance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image analysis _cite_ . The main advantage of a CNN is related to its deep architecture, characterized by a series of layers able to extract from raw data a set of discriminative features, not designed by human engineers _cite_, in order to operate classifications tasks or image captions. In this work we exploited CNN to develop an automatic calcium scoring system, able to identify true coronary calcifications and discard other lesions, on ECG-gated basal CT acquisitions. The performance of the CNN-based automatic method for coronary calcium scoring was evaluated and compared with reference standard calcium score values obtained with manual annotations.
