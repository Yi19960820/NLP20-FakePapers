One of the hallmarks of high-level intelligence is flexibility _cite_ . Humans can respond differentially to the same stimulus according to contexts, such as different goals, environments, and internal states _cite_ . The prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is highly elaborated in primates, is pivotal for such an ability _cite_ . The PFC can quickly learn ``rules of the game" and dynamically apply them to map the sensory inputs to different actions in a context-dependent way _cite_ . This process, named cognitive control, allows primates to behave appropriately in an unlimited number of situations _cite_ . {With impaired PFC, the subjects' reaction are largely dictated by stronger sensory stimuli and they lose the ability to respond to task-related, weaker stimuli _cite_ . In addition, these subjects tend to stubbornly follow the established rules in behavioral tasks even when the rules no longer bring desirable outcome, i.e., they lose the ability to dynamically adjust the mapping between the sensory inputs and the motor outputs _cite_ . Not only the experiments with PFC-impaired human patients show that this areas is the key for flexible, context-dependent processing, numerous electrophysiological studies in non-human primates have also demonstrated that the PFC neurons can indeed represent various contextual-related information _cite_ . Such ability of flexible, context-dependent processing empowered by the PFC is quite different from the current artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) .} DNNs are very powerful in extracting high-level features from raw sensory data and learning sophisticated mapping rules for pattern detection, recognition, and classification _cite_ . {However, except for the recently proposed approaches of meta-learning and few-shot learning _cite_, in majority of networks the responses are largely dictated by the sensory inputs, exhibiting stereotyped input-output mappings, and these mappings are usually fixed once the training is completed.} Therefore, the current DNNs lack enough flexibility to work in complex situations in which N) the mapping rules may change according to context and N) these rules need to be learned ``on the go" from a small number of training trials. This constitutes a significant ability gap between DNNs and human brains.
