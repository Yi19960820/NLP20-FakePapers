ND human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human ND pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate ND pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent ND Pose Sequence Machine (RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the ND pose sequences based on the previously learned ND pose representations and ND poses: (i) a ND pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a ND pose recurrent module regressing ND poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from ND to ND domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the N dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for ND pose estimation.
