Despite the considerable success of convolutional neural networks in a broad array of domains, recent research has shown these to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations, commonly known as adversarial examples. Moreover, such examples have shown to be remarkably portable, or transferable, from one model to another, enabling highly successful black-box attacks. We explore this issue of transferability and robustness from two dimensions: first, considering the impact of conventional _inline_eq_ regularization as well as replacing the top layer with a linear support vector machine (SVM), and second, the value of combining regularized models into an ensemble. We show that models trained with different regularizers present barriers to transferability, as does partial information about the models comprising the ensemble.
