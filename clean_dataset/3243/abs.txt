In this paper, an optic disc and cup segmentation method is proposed using U-Net followed by a multi-scale feature matching network. The proposed method targets task N of the REFUGE challenge N. In order to solve the segmentation problem of task N, we firstly crop the input image using single shot multibox detector (SSD) . The cropped image is then passed to an encoder-decoder network with skip connections also known as generator. Afterwards, both the ground truth and generated images are fed to a convolution neural network (CNN) to extract their multi-level features. A dice loss function is then used to match the features of the two images by minimizing the error at each layer. The aggregation of error from each layer is back-propagated through the generator network to enforce it to generate a segmented image closer to the ground truth. The CNN network improves the performance of the generator network without increasing the complexity of the model.
