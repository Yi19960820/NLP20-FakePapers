Image restoration tasks such as denoising and super-resolution are essential steps in many practical image processing applications. Over the last few decades, various algorithms have been developed, which include non-local self-similarity (NSS) models _cite_, total variation (TV) approaches _cite_, and sparse dictionary learning models _cite_ . Among them, the block matching ND filter (BMND) _cite_ is considered as the state-of-the art algorithm. In general, these methods are dependent on the noise model. Moreover, these algorithms are usually implemented in an iterative manner, so they require significant computational resources. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved tremendous success in classification~ _cite_ as well as low-level computer vision problems ~ _cite_ . In image denoising and super-resolution tasks, many state-of-the-art CNN algorithms _cite_ have been proposed. Although the performance of these algorithms usually outperforms the non-local and collaboration filtering approaches such as BMND, in case of certain images that have many patterns (such as Barbara image), CNN approaches are still inferior to BMND. Therefore, one of the main motivations of this work is to develop a new CNN architecture that overcomes the limitation of the state-of-the-art CNN approaches. The proposed network architectures are motivated from a novel {\em persistent homology} analysis _cite_ on residual learning for image processing tasks. Specifically, we show that the residual manifold is topologically simpler than the original image manifold, which may have attributed the success of residual learning. Moreover, this observation leads us to a new network design principle using {\em manifold simplification} . Specifically, our design goal is to find mappings for input and/or label datasets to feature spaces, respectively, such that the new datasets become topologically simpler and easier to learn. In particular, we show that the wavelet transform provides topologically simpler manifold structures while preserving the directional edge information. {\bf Contribution}: In summary, our contributions are as following. First, a novel network design principle using manifold simplification is proposed. Second, using a recent computational topology tool called the persistent homology, we show that the existing residual learning is a special case of manifold simplification and then propose a wavelet transform to simplify topological structures of input and/or label manifolds.
