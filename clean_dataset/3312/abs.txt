In the current era, biometric based access control is becoming more popular due to its simplicity and ease to use by the users. It reduces the manual work of identity recognition and facilitates the automatic processing. The face is one of the most important biometric visual information that can be easily captured without user cooperation in an uncontrolled environment. Precise detection of spoofed faces should be on the high priority to make face based identity recognition and access control robust against possible attacks. The recently evolved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning technique has proven as one of the excellent method to deal with the visual information very effectively. The CNN learns the hierarchical features at intermediate layers automatically from the data. Several CNN based methods such as Inception and ResNet have shown outstanding performance for image classification problem. This paper does a performance evaluation of CNNs for face anti-spoofing. The Inception and ResNet CNN architectures are used in this study. The results are computed over benchmark MSU Mobile Face Spoofing Database. The experiments are done by considering the different aspects such as the depth of the model, random weight initialization vs weight transfer, fine tuning vs training from scratch and different learning rate. The favorable results are obtained using these CNN architectures for face anti-spoofing in different settings.
