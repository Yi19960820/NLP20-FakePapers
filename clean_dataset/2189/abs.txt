In this work, we propose an advanced AI-based grading system for OCT images. The proposed system is a very deep fully convolutional attentive classification network trained with end-to-end advanced transfer learning with online random augmentation. It uses quasi-random augmentation that outputs confidence values for diseases prevalence during inference. Itâ€™s a fully automated retinal OCT analysis AI system capable of pathological lesions understanding without any offline preprocessing/postprocessing step or manual feature extraction. We present a state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available Mendeley OCT dataset.
