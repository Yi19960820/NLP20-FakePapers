Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are shown to be successful at generating new and realistic samples including ND object models. Conditional GAN, a variant of GANs, allows generating samples in given conditions. However, objects generated for each condition are different and it does not allow generation of the same object in different conditions. In this paper, we first adapt conditional GAN, which is originally designed for ND image generation, to the problem of generating ND models in different rotations. We then propose a new approach to guide the network to generate the same ND sample in different and controllable rotation angles (sample pairs) . Unlike previous studies, the proposed method does not require modification of the standard conditional GAN architecture and it can be integrated into the training step of any conditional GAN. Experimental results and visual comparison of ND models show that the proposed method is successful at generating model pairs in different conditions.
