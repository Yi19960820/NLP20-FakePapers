Designing a network on ND surface for non-rigid shape analysis is a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel spectral transform network on ND surface to learn shape descriptors. The proposed network architecture consists of four stages: raw descriptor extraction, surface second-order pooling, mixture of power function-based spectral transform, and metric learning. The proposed network is simple and shallow. Quantitative experiments on challenging benchmarks show its effectiveness for non-rigid shape retrieval and classification, e.g., it achieved the highest accuracies on SHREC'N, N datasets as well as the ``range'' subset of SHREC'N dataset.
