In this project, competition-winning deep neural networks with pretrained weights are used for image-based gender recognition and age estimation. Transfer learning is explored using both ILSVRC and facial recognition weights by testing the effects of changes in various design schemes and training parameters in order to improve prediction accuracy. Training techniques such as input standardization, data augmentation, and label distribution age encoding are compared. Finally, a hierarchy of deep CNNs is tested that first classifies subjects by gender, and then uses separate male and female age models to predict age. A gender recognition accuracy of N \% and an average age error of N years is achieved. This paper shows that, with proper training techniques, good results can be obtained by retasking existing convolutional filters towards a new purpose.
