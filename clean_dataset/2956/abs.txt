Detecting lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is an important but difficult problem because non-lesions and true lesions can appear similar. ND context is known to be helpful in this differentiation task. However, existing end-to-end detection frameworks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are mostly designed for ND images. In this paper, we propose ND context enhanced region-based CNN (NDCE) to incorporate ND context information efficiently by aggregating feature maps of ND images. NDCE is easy to train and end-to-end in training and inference. A universal lesion detector is developed to detect all kinds of lesions in one algorithm using the DeepLesion dataset. Experimental results on this challenging task prove the effectiveness of NDCE. We have released the code of NDCE in .
