This paper investigates the automatic monitoring of tool usage during a surgery, with potential applications in report generation, surgical training and real-time decision support. Following state-of-the-art video analysis solutions, each frame of the video is analyzed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose outputs are fed to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in order to take temporal relationships between events into account. Novelty lies in the way those CNNs and RNNs are trained. Computational complexity prevents the end-to-end training of ``CNN + RNN'' systems. Therefore, CNNs are usually trained first, independently from the RNNs. This approach is clearly suboptimal for surgical tool analysis: many tools are very similar to one another, but they can generally be differentiated based on past events. CNNs should be trained to extract the most useful visual features in combination with the temporal context. A novel boosting strategy is proposed to achieve this goal: the CNN and RNN parts of the system are simultaneously enriched by progressively adding weak classifiers (either CNNs or RNNs) trained to improve the overall classification accuracy.
