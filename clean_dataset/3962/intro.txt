The Task N of ISIC N challenge in Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection _cite_ is defined as to generate the binary classification corresponding to each of the N disease classes: melanoma, melanocytic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, dermatofibroma and vascular lesion for each test image. The predicted responses are then scored using balanced normalized accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel framework, data augmentation and bagging ensemble architecture (DABEA), that uses data augmentation and bagging in combination to generate multiple output vectors per model and then applies a _inline_eq_ convolution layer as a meta-learner for combining different model outputs. Our main contributions includes using (i) an ensemble DNN models with data augmentation and bagging and (ii) a _inline_eq_ convolution layer for meta-learning of models.
