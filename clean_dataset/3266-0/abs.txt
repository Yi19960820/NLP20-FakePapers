We present a method for human pose tracking that is based on learning spatiotemporal relationships among joints. Beyond generating the heatmap of a joint in a given frame, our system also learns to predict the offset of the joint from a neighboring joint in the frame. Additionally, it is trained to predict the displacement of the joint from its position in the previous frame, in a manner that can account for possibly changing joint appearance, unlike optical flow. These relational cues in the spatial domain and temporal domain are inferred in a robust manner by attending only to relevant areas in the video frames. By explicitly learning and exploiting these joint relationships, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for various pose tracking tasks including ND body pose tracking in RGB video, ND hand pose tracking in depth sequences, and ND hand gesture tracking in RGB video.
