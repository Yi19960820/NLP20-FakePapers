Heterogeneous face recognition between color image and depth image is a much desired capacity for real world applications where shape information is looked upon as merely involved in gallery. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal deep learning method as an effective and efficient workaround for this challenge. Specifically, we begin with learning two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract ND and N face features individually. Once trained, they can serve as pre-trained models for another two-way CNN which explores the correlated part between color and depth for heterogeneous matching. Compared with most conventional cross-modal approaches, our method additionally conducts accurate depth image reconstruction from single color image with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN), and further enhances the recognition performance by fusing multi-modal matching results. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments on benchmark FRGC ND/ND face database, we demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art performance on heterogeneous face recognition and ensures a drastically efficient on-line stage.
