Recently, vision-based Advanced Driver Assist Systems have gained broad interest. In this work, we investigate free-space detection, for which we propose to employ a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) . We show that this FCN can be trained in a manner and achieve similar results compared to training on manually annotated data, thereby reducing the need for large manually annotated training sets. To this end, our self-supervised training relies on a stereo-vision disparity system, to automatically generate (weak) training labels for the color-based FCN. Additionally, our self-supervised training facilitates training of the FCN instead of offline. Consequently, given that the applied FCN is relatively small, the free-space analysis becomes highly adaptive to any traffic scene that the vehicle encounters. We have validated our algorithm using publicly available data and on a new challenging benchmark dataset that is released with this paper. Experiments show that the online training boosts performance with _inline_eq_ when compared to offline training, both for _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ .
