Current CNN-based algorithms for recovering the ND pose of an object in an image assume knowledge about both the object category and its ND localization in the image. In this paper, we relax one of these constraints and propose to solve the task of joint object category and ND pose estimation from an image assuming known ND localization. We design a new architecture for this task composed of a feature network that is shared between subtasks, an object categorization network built on top of the feature network, and a collection of category dependent pose regression networks. We also introduce suitable loss functions and a training method for the new architecture. Experiments on the challenging PASCALND + dataset show state-of-the-art performance in the joint categorization and pose estimation task. Moreover, our performance on the joint task is comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the simpler ND pose estimation with known object category task.
