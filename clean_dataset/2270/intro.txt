After the success of the AlexNet~ _cite_ convolutional neural network (CNN) in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) ~ _cite_, deep neural networks~ _cite_ have been widely adopted in the computer vision community to solve various tasks ranging from object detection~ _cite_ and recognition~ _cite_ to face recognition~ _cite_ and even image difficulty estimation~ _cite_ . In the usual paradigm, a deep neural network (DNN) ~ _cite_ is trained on thousands of labeled images in order to learn a function that classifies the input images into multiple classes, according the labels associated to the images. In this paper, we propose a different paradigm in which the neural network is trained on a single image in order to memorize (encode) the image by learning a function that maps the ND pixel coordinates to the corresponding values in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space. At test time, given a ND pixel coordinate, the neural network will output the approximate RGB values of the corresponding pixel. By considering every ND pixel location, the network can actually reconstruct the entire learned image at the original scale. By taking pixel locations at different intervals, the network can also reconstruct the image at various scales. We coin the term for our neural network, i.e. co ordinates-to-co lor net work. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a neural approach for encoding images individually, by learning a mapping from the ND pixel coordinate space to the RGB color space. Our novel paradigm enables the application of neural networks for various low-level image processing tasks, without requiring a training set of images. Applications include, but are not limited to, image encoding, image compression, image denoising, image resampling, image restoration and image completion. In this paper, we focus on only three of these tasks, namely image denoising, image upsampling (super-resolution) and image completion. First of all, we present empirical evidence that CocoNet is able to surpass standard image denoising methods on the CIFAR-N data set~ _cite_ . Second of all, we show that our approach can obtain better upsampling results compared to bicubic interpolation on a set of images usually employed in image super-resolution, known as SetN~ _cite_ . We also present qualitative results for the task of image completion on SetN. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present related works in Section~ _ref_ . We describe our approach in Section~ _ref_ . We present the results of our image denoising, image upsampling and image completion results in Section~ _ref_ . Finally, we draw our conclusion and discuss future work in Section~ _ref_ .
