Retinal images have the highest resolution and clarity among medical images. Thus, vessel analysis in retinal images may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of many chronic diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale residual convolutional neural network structure based on a block of layers, comprising subsampling and subsequent upsampling, for multi-scale representation. Through analysis in the frequency domain, we show that this block structure is a close approximation of Gaussian filtering, the operation to achieve scale variations in scale-space theory. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Ablative analysis shows that the SSA is indeed an important factor in performance improvement.
