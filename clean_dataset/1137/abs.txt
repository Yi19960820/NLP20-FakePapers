Deep learning have been shown to outperform traditional machine learning algorithms across a wide range of problem domains. However, current deep learning algorithms are essentially uninterpretable "black-boxes" without any explanations associated with their decision making processes. This is a major shortcoming that prevents widespread use of deep learning to be used in scenarios with regulatory processes such as finance. As such, industries such as finance have to rely on traditional models like decision trees that are much more interpretable but less effective than deep learning for complex problems. In this paper, we propose CLEAR-Trade, a novel financial AI visualization framework for deep learning-driven stock market prediction that mitigates the interpretability issue of deep learning. In particular, CLEAR-Trade provides a effective way to visualize and explain decisions made by deep stock market prediction models. We show the efficacy of CLEAR-Trade in enhancing the interpretability of stock market prediction by conducting experiments based on S \&P N stock index prediction. The results clearly demonstrate that CLEAR-Trade can provide significant insight into the decision-making process of the deep learning-driven financial models, particularly for regulatory processes, thus improving their potential widespread adoption in finance.
