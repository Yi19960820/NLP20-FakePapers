Here we explore two related but important tasks based on the recently released REalistic Single Image DEhazing (RESIDE) benchmark dataset: (i) single image dehazing as a low-level image restoration problem; and (ii) high-level visual understanding (e.g., object detection) of hazy images. For the first task, we investigated a variety of loss functions and show that perception-driven loss significantly improves dehazing performance. In the second task, we provide multiple solutions including using advanced modules in the dehazing-detection cascade and domain-adaptive object detectors. In both tasks, our proposed solutions significantly improve performance. GitHub repository URL: _url_ .
