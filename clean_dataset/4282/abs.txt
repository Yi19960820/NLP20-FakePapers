Text line detection and localization is a crucial step for full page document analysis, but still suffers from heterogeneity of real life documents. In this paper, we present a new approach for full page text recognition. Localization of the text lines is based on regressions with Fully Convolutional Neural Networks and Multidimensional Long Short-Term Memory as contextual layers. In order to increase the efficiency of this localization method, only the position of the left side of the text lines are predicted. The text recognizer is then in charge of predicting the end of the text to recognize. This method has shown good results for full page text recognition on the highly heterogeneous Maurdor dataset.
