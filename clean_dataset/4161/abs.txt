Global Average Pooling (GAP) _cite_ has been used previously to generate class activation for image classification tasks. The motivation behind SIMILARnet comes from the fact that the convolutional filters possess position information of the essential features and hence, combination of the feature maps could help us locate the class instances in an image. We propose a biologically inspired model that is free of differential connections and doesn't require separate training thereby reducing computation overhead. Our novel architecture generates promising results and unlike existing methods, the model is not sensitive to the input image size, thus promising wider application.
