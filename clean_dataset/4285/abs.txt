With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), data augmentation and generation are quickly evolving domains that have raised much interest recently. However, the DL techniques are data demanding and since, medical data is not easily accessible, they suffer from data insufficiency. To deal with this limitation, different data augmentation techniques are used. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised data-driven approach for data augmentation that can generate ND Computed Tomography (CT) images using a simple GAN. The generated CT images have good global and local features of a real CT image and can be used to augment the training datasets for effective learning. In this proof-of-concept study, we show that our proposed solution using GANs is able to capture some of the global and local CT variabilities. Our network is able to generate visually realistic CT images and we aim to further enhance its output by scaling it to a higher resolution and potentially from ND to ND.
