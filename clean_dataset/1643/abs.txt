Crowd counting is one of the core tasks in various surveillance applications. A practical system involves estimating accurate head counts in dynamic scenarios under different lightning, camera perspective and occlusion states. Previous approaches estimate head counts despite that they can vary dramatically in different density settings; the crowd is often unevenly distributed and the results are therefore unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework that can automatically estimate the crowd density level and adaptively choose between different counter networks that are explicitly trained for different density domains. Experiments on two recent crowd counting datasets, UCF \_CC \_N and ShanghaiTech, show that the proposed mechanism achieves promising improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, runtime speed is N FPS on a single GPU.
