Deep learning has developed rapidly recently due to the availability and large scale of labeled data, and high performance computing. Deep learning is currently one of the most popular machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) _cite_ . In computer vision, many classical techniques of feature extraction and subspace learning have been eclipsed due to the recent good performance in deep learning. Traditionally, good results have been obtained using combinations of classifiers, regressors, hand-crafted features, facial landmarks, and dimensionality reduction _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . Neural networks, however, have taken the scene with their ability to learn and memorize features, and keep improving in accuracy as more data are observed. Thus Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have far surpassed traditional classification and regression techniques, and have even surpassed human performance on a number of well-known benchmarks _cite_ _cite_ .
