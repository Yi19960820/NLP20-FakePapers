Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and versatile non-invasive imaging modality, which is widely used for the diagnosis of pathologies. However, most MRI techniques are restricted to qualitative imaging and are not capable of characterizing tissue in an objective and reproducible fashion. To overcome this limitation, magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has recently been proposed _cite_ . MRF scans an object multiple times with varying experimental parameters, and generates unique signal evolutions (or) as a function of the multiple material properties under investigation. The most likely material of each image pixel is estimated by matching its measured fingerprint with a set of pre-calculated fingerprints in a dictionary, and choosing the one with the maximum dot-product. The MRF acquisition is designed as a simultaneous function of multiple tissue parameters and therefore several MR parameters can be reconstructed from a single acquisition. Quantitative maps of these parameters are produced from the results of the dictionary matching in a pixel-wise fashion _cite_ (see Fig. _ref_) . However, this dictionary matching process is time-consuming, lacks scalability, and can introduce artefacts due to under-sampling of k-space during the MRF data acquisition _cite_ .
