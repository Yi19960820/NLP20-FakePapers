Across a majority of pedestrian detection datasets, it is typically assumed that pedestrians will be standing upright with respect to the image coordinate system. This assumption however, is not always valid for many vision-equipped mobile platforms such as mobile phones, UAVs or construction vehicles on rugged terrain. In these situations, the motion of the camera can cause images of pedestrians to be captured at extreme angles. This can lead to very poor pedestrian detection performance when using standard pedestrian detectors. To address this issue, we propose a Rotational Rectification Network (RNN) that can be inserted into any CNN-based pedestrian (or object) detector to adapt it to significant changes in camera rotation. The rotational rectification network uses a ND rotation estimation module that passes rotational information to a spatial transformer network _cite_ to undistort image features. To enable robust rotation estimation, we propose a Global Polar Pooling (GP-Pooling) operator to capture rotational shifts in convolutional features. Through our experiments, we show how our rotational rectification network can be used to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art pedestrian detector under heavy image rotation by up to N
