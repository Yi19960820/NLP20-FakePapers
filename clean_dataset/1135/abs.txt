Estimating action quality, the process of assigning a "score" to the execution of an action, is crucial in areas such as sports and health care. Unlike action recognition, which has millions of examples to learn from, the action quality datasets that are currently available are small--typically comprised of only a few hundred samples. This work presents three frameworks for evaluating Olympic sports which utilize spatiotemporal features learned using ND convolutional neural networks (CND) and perform score regression with i) SVR, ii) LSTM, and iii) LSTM followed by SVR. An efficient training mechanism for the limited data scenarios is presented for clip-based training with LSTM. The proposed systems show significant improvement over existing quality assessment approaches on the task of predicting scores of Olympic events . While the SVR-based frameworks yield better results, LSTM-based frameworks are more natural for describing an action and can be used for improvement feedback.
