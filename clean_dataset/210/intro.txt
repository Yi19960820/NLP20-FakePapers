Deep learning is widely used for image classification with great success _cite_ _cite_ . However, neural networks can not be directly applied to very high resolution images, such as Whole Slide Tissue images, due to the high computational cost involved. A common solution consists in dividing the image into patches and using patch-level annotations to train a supervised classifier. However, patch-level annotations are not usually available, especially when working with medical datasets. On the contrary, image-level annotations are much easier to obtain so practitioners have used Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to train patch-level classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, aggregating patch-level predictions into image-level scores _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . When the input images are small enough, the MIL formulation can be implemented using a global Max Pooling layer at the output of a Fully Convolutional Network _cite_ . However, in the case of high resolution images, this implementation is not possible due to memory constraints. This is why patches are usually sampled using a regular grid (with or without overlap) _cite_ _cite_ before being fed to the neural network. Grid sampling may skip some zones in the image which might be relevant for classification, and concentrate too much effort in zones which are not. In this work we propose a novel patch sampling strategy which extracts knowledge from the network to focus attention on the most discriminative regions in an image for a given instant in the training process, permitting better convergence and higher generalization performance. We compare this approach to uniform sampling and conventional grid sampling on two artificial and two histological datasets.
