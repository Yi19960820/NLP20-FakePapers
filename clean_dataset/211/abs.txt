Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated superior performance on single image depth estimation in recent years. These works usually use stacked spatial pooling or strided convolution to get high-level information which are common practices in classification task. However, depth estimation is a dense prediction problem and low-resolution feature maps usually generate blurred depth map which is undesirable in application. In order to produce high quality depth map, say clean and accurate, we propose a network consists of a Dense Feature Extractor (DFE) and a Depth Map Generator (DMG) . The DFE combines ResNet and dilated convolutions. It extracts multi-scale information from input image while keeping the feature maps dense. As for DMG, we use attention mechanism to fuse multi-scale features produced in DFE. Our Network is trained end-to-end and does not need any post-processing. Hence, it runs fast and can predict depth map in about N fps. Experiment results show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in quantitative evaluation, but can preserve better structural details of the scene depth.
