The sharpening of blurred images is a standard problem in many imaging applications. A great variety of different approaches to this severely ill-posed inverse problem have been developped over time which differ in the assumptions they make, and in their suitability for different application contexts. \medskip Blur of an image is described by a which describes the redistribution of light energy in the image domain _inline_eq_ . When blurring acts equally at all locations, one has a _inline_eq_ which acts by convolution. Accounting also for the impact of noise _inline_eq_, a typical blur model (with additive noise) then reads where _inline_eq_ is the observed image, and _inline_eq_ the unknown sharp image. In the more general case of a space-variant blur one needs a point-spread function with two arguments, _inline_eq_, and _inline_eq_ is replaced with the integral operator such that which subsumes the space-invariant case by setting _inline_eq_ . We denote by _inline_eq_ the adjoint of the point-spread function _inline_eq_, which is given by _inline_eq_ . Conservation of energy implies generally that _inline_eq_, however, this condition may be violated near image boundaries due to blurring across the boundary. In deblurring, we want to obtain a restored image _inline_eq_ that approximates _inline_eq_, with the degraded image _inline_eq_ and the PSF _inline_eq_ as input. This is the case of deconvolution (as opposed to blind deconvolution which aims at inferring the sharp image and the PSF simultaneously from the degraded image) . Some approaches to the deconvolution problem are presented in more detail in Section~ _ref_ . The main subject of this paper is to discuss a modification of the Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution method _cite_ by robust data terms. Building on the known variational interpretation of RL deconvolution _cite_, we replace the asymmetric penaliser function in the data term in such a way that larger residual errors are penalised less than with the standard Csisz \'ar divergence term. Using robust data terms together with a regulariser similar to _cite_ we obtain a robust and regularised Richardson-Lucy variant that unites the high restoration quality of variational deconvolution methods with high efficiency that is not far from the original Richardson-Lucy iteration. This method has already been used for experiments on recovering information from diffuse reflections in _cite_ and, combined with interpolation, for the enhancement of confocal microscopy images _cite_ . It has also been used to achieve efficient deconvolution under real-time or almost-real-time conditions _cite_ . We demonstrate that both robust data terms and regularisers contribute substantially to its performance. An earlier version of the present work is the technical report _cite_ . The omnipresence of deblurring problems has made researchers address this problem since long _cite_ . From the abundant literature on this topic, the most relevant work in our present context includes Richardson-Lucy deconvolution _cite_, variational methods _cite_, and their interplay _cite_ ; see also _cite_ for another approach to combine Richardson-Lucy deconvolution with regularisation. Fundamental theoretical results on existence and uniqueness of solutions of deconvolution problems can be found in the work of Bertero et al. \ _cite_ . Robust data terms in deconvolution go back to Zervakis et al. \ _cite_ in statistical models, and have recently been used intensively in the variational context by Bar et al. cite {Bar-scsN, Bar-ssvmN} and Welk et al. cite {Welk-ibpriaN, Welk-dagmN} . Positivity constraints were studied in discrete iterative deconvolution by Nagy and Strako {\v s} _cite_ and in a variational framework by Welk and Nagy _cite_ . The extension of variational approaches to multi-channel images has been studied in _cite_ and more specifically in deconvolution in _cite_ . In Section~ _ref_ we recall approaches to image deconvolution which form the background for our approach, and discuss some aspects of noise models and robustness. Section~ _ref_ recalls the embedding of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution into a variational context. Exploiting this connection, the RL algorithm can be modified in order to increase restoration quality and robustness with respect to noise and perturbations. An experimental comparison of the deconvolution techniques under consideration is provided in Section~ _ref_ based on both synthetic and real-world data. Conclusions in Section~ _ref_ end the paper.
