Face detection is a fundamental and essential step for many face related applications, e.g. face landmark~ _cite_ and face recognition~ _cite_ . Starting from the pioneering work of Viola-Jones~ _cite_, face detection witnessed a large number of progress, especially as the recent development of convolutional neural networks~ _cite_ . However, the occlusion problem is still a challenging problem and few of the work have been presented to address this issue. More importantly, occlusion caused by mask, sunglasses or other faces widely exists in the real-life applications. The difficulty to address the occlusion issue lies at the risk of potential false positive problem. Considering the case of detecting a face occluded by a sunglasses, only the lower part of face is available. The models, which can recognize the face only based on the lower part, will be easily misclassified at the positions like hands which share the similar skin color. How to successfully address the occlusion issue and meanwhile prevent the false positive problem is still a challenging research topic. In this paper, we present an effective face detector based on the one-shot detection pipeline called Face Attention Network (FAN), which can well address the occlusion and false positive issue. More specifically, following the similar setting as RetinaNet~ _cite_, we utilize feature pyramid network, and different layers from the network to solve the faces with different scales. Our anchor setting is designed specifically for the face application and an anchor-level attention is introduced which provides different attention regions for different feature layers. The attention is supervised trained based on the anchor-specific heatmaps. In addition, data augmentation like random crop is introduced to generate more cropped (occluded) training samples. In summary, there are three contributions in our paper.
