Mammography screening is the most reliable method for early detection of breast carcinomas~ _cite_ . Among diverse types of breast abnormalities, such as micro-calcifications or architectural distortion, breast masses are the most important findings since they may be pointing out the presence of malignant tumors _cite_ . However, to locate masses and discern mass borders are difficult tasks because of their high variability, low contrast and high similarity with the surrounding healthy tissue, as well as their low signal-to-noise ratio _cite_ . Therefore, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are highly recommended for helping radiologists in detecting masses, outlining their borders (mass segmentation) and suggesting their morphological features, such as shape type (irregular, lobular, oval and round) and margin type (circumscribed, obscured, ill-defined, spiculated) . Recent studies point out some loose correlations between mass features and molecular subtypes, i.e., Luminal-A, Luminal-B, HER-N (Human Epidermal growth factor receptor N) and Basal-like (triple negative), which are key for prescribing the best oncological treatment _cite_ . Although it is impossible for an expert radiologist to discern the molecular subtypes from the mammography. Recently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to classify molecular subtypes using texture based descriptors of image crops of mass area _cite_, which yielded an overall accuracy of _inline_eq_ . In this paper, we present a novel approach for N) breast mass segmentation based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) _cite_, N) to predict the mass shape type (irregular, lobular, oval and round) from the binary mask of the mass area. Beside these two contributions, this paper provides a study of the correlation between the mass shape and molecular subtypes.
