Image registration or image alignment is the process of overlaying two images taken at different time instants, or different view points, or from different subjects in a common coordinate system. Image registration has remained a significant tool in medical imaging applications _cite_ . ND data in medical images, where image registration is applied, generally includes Computed Tomography (CT), Cone-beam CT (CBCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of medical devices. Among all the image registration methods, deformable image registration is important in neuroscience and clinical studies. Diffeomorphic demons _cite_ and Log-domain diffeomorphic demon _cite_ algorithms are popular deformable registration methods. In these optimization-based methods, the deformable transformation parameters are iteratively optimized over a scalar valued cost (e.g., SSD) representing the quality of registration _cite_ . To impose smoothness on the solution, typically a regularization term is also added to the registration cost function. These costs are non-convex in nature, hence the optimization sometimes get trapped in the local minima. On the basis of the cost functions, different optimization algorithms are used. In the Gauss-Newton method for minimizing SSD, projective geometric deformation is used _cite_ . The method is sensitive to local minima. Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm was used in _cite_ to minimize the difference in intensities of corresponding pixels. This method update the parameters between gradient descent and Gauss Newton and accelerates towards local minima. The combination of Levenber-Marquadt method and SSD is used in _cite_ . In order to improve the solution of registration, in other words, to find better local minima in the SSD cost, we propose a novel method to modify the reference image by introducing a heatmap (essentially another image) produced by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) with a skip architecture _cite_ . This modified reference image helps to create a tight upper bound to the SSD registration cost that we refer to as UB-SSD. Next, we minimize the UB-SSD by adjusting parameters of the FCNN as well as deformation parameters of the registration algorithm. We refer to our proposed method by deep deformable registration (DDR) . FCNN is type of deep learning machine that has has been successfully used for semantic segmentation in _cite_ . In _cite_ convolutional network has been used to classify N million images in N different classes. However, our proposed method (DDR) does not employ any learning, rather it uses FCNN to optimize SSD registration cost. It is a newer trend in computer vision and graphics, where deep learning tools are used only for optimization purposes and not for learning. One prominent example is artistic style transfer _cite_ . Prior to our work, convolutional network was used for image registration in _cite_, where the authors trained the parameters of a N-layers convolutional network. The network was used to seek the hierarchical representation for each image, where high level features are inferred from the low level network. The goal of their work was to learn feature vectors for better registration. In contrast, DDR focuses on finding better solution during optimization, where we make use of end-to-end back-propagation and the deep learning architecture.
