The recent advances of convolutional detectors show for large scale object detection. However, in general, the detection performance usually decreases as the object classes to be detected increases, and it is a practically challenging to train a dominant model for all classes due to the limitations of detection models and . In most cases, therefore, there distinct performance of the modern convolutional detectors for each object class . In this paper,, we present a conceptually simple but very effective class-wise The main benefit of our method is easy to implement and does not require any for ensemble. Based on the proposed, we won the Nnd place .
