We describe a deep learning approach for automated brain hemorrhage detection from computed tomography (CT) scans. Our model emulates the procedure followed by radiologists to analyse a ND CT scan in real-world. Similar to radiologists, the model sifts through ND cross-sectional slices while paying close attention to potential hemorrhagic regions. Further, the model utilizes ND context from neighboring slices to improve predictions at each slice and subsequently, aggregates the slice-level predictions to provide diagnosis at CT level. We refer to our proposed approach as Recurrent Attention DenseNet (RADnet) as it employs original DenseNet architecture along with adding the components of attention for slice level predictions and recurrent neural network layer for incorporating ND context. The real-world performance of RADnet has been benchmarked against independent analysis performed by three senior radiologists for N brain CTs. RADnet demonstrates N \% hemorrhage prediction accuracy at CT level that is comparable to radiologists. Further, RADnet achieves higher recall than two of the three radiologists, which is remarkable.
