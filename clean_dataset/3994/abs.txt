In this work, we propose a straightforward method to derive Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key pairs from embeddings created using Deep Learning and Metric Learning approaches. We also show that these keys allows the derivation of cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) addresses that can be used to transfer and receive funds, allowing novel Blockchain-based applications that can be used to transfer funds or data directly to domains such as image, text, sound or any other domain where Deep Learning can extract high-quality embeddings; providing thus a novel integration between the properties of the Blockchain-based technologies such as trust minimization and decentralization together with the high-quality learned representations from Deep Learning techniques.
