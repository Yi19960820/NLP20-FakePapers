Modeling (representing) their environments is crucial for cognitive as well as artificial agents. For a robot, scene modeling pertains to representing a scene in such a way that the robot can reason about the scene and the objects in it in an efficient manner. A scene model should allow for the robot to check, for example, (i) whether there is a a certain object in the scene and where it is, or (ii) whether it is in the right place in the scene or (iii) whether there is something redundant in the scene to be moved to some place else. Although there are many studies on scene modeling in robotics and computer vision (e.g., _cite_), to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first that uses a multi-way Boltzmann Machines for the task. Boltzmann Machines (BM) _cite_ are stochastic generative models that offer many benefits for various modeling problems. The benefits of Boltzmann Machines include (among others) the presence of latent nodes, which function as context variables modulating the object activations, the ease to extend with the requirements of scene modeling, and its generative capability. Although BM existed beforehand, they became popular again with extensions to deep architectures or restricted connections (i.e., Restricted Boltzmann Machines) . Scene Modeling: Many models have been proposed for scene modeling in computer vision and robotics using probabilistic models such as Markov or Conditional Random Fields _cite_, Bayesian Networks _cite_, Latent Dirichlet Allocation variants _cite_, Dirichlet and Beta processes _cite_, chain-graphs _cite_, predicate logic _cite_, and Scene Graphs _cite_ . There have also been many attempts for ontology-based scene modeling where objects and various types of relations are modeled _cite_ . Among these, _cite_ use context either in representing the scene or solving a task using the scene model for a robotics problem. These studies model context via local interactions between visible variables, except for _cite_ who proposed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for modeling context. Relation Estimation and Reasoning: Early studies on integrating relations into scene modeling and analysis tasks were rule-based. These approaches defined relations using rules based on ND/ND distances between objects, e.g., _cite_ . With advances in probabilistic graphical modeling, many approaches used models such as Markov Random Fields _cite_, Conditional Random Fields _cite_, Implicit Shape Models _cite_, latent generative models _cite_ . Many studies also proposed formulating relation detection as a classification problem, e.g., using logistic regression _cite_, and deep learning _cite_ . The main contributions of our work are the following: We evaluate our extended DBM model on many practical robot problems: Determining (i) what is missing in a scene, (ii) relations between objects, (iii) what should not be in a scene, (iv) random scene generation given some objects or relations from the to-be-generated scene. We compare our model (Triway BM) against DBM _cite_ with N-way relations (GBM), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) _cite_ .
