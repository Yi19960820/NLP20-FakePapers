In recent years there has been an explosion in the proliferation of head-mounted wearable devices, with products such as smart eyewear (SEW) devices _cite_, smart ear-buds _cite_, and smart headwear _cite_ . Most of these devices come with in-built accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, which can measure a variety of the wearer's head and body movements. One of the potential uses of such head-mounted wearable devices is to provide new sources of biometrics for authentication _cite_ . Our principal {\bf goal} in this paper is to develop a passive authentication approach using head-mounted wearable devices (i.e., it works without requiring explicit action or gestures of any kind from the wearer) . Passive authentication approaches are more difficult for adversaries to copy and spoof. Physiological signals (e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG)) make good biometrics for enabling passive authentication due to their inherently limited observability for adversaries. Our strategy is to use measurements from the two {\em movement sensors} (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope) on head-mounted wearable devices and use them to derive something called a {\bf ballistocardiogram (BCG)} . BCG represents the body's motion as the blood flows through it, in response to the beating of the heart, and thus captures the characteristics of the cardiac cycle _cite_ . We derive the BCG used for authentication by asking each subject to sit still and then capturing and filtering the subtle and involuntary head movements that their body makes as a result of the pumping action of the heart. In fact we divide the sensor measurements into fixed-duration {\em segments} and derive six versions of BCG (which we refer to as {\em BCG waveforms}), one for each axis of the accelerometer and gyroscope, from each segment. The BCG waveforms from several segments are then used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, which acts as the {\em authentication model} . Each authentication model is subject-specific (i.e., personalized), therefore different subjects have their own models. Once the models are trained, {\em authentication} is done by collecting one (or more) segment (s) of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from an {\em unknown subject} wearing the head-mounted wearable device. The sensor measurements in the segment are filtered to derive six BCG waveforms, which are then fed into a subject-specific model (belonging to the subject in our system that the unknown subject claims to be) . This model determines if these newly derived BCG waveforms are similar to the waveforms already seen from the subject earlier during model training. If deemed sufficiently similar, the unknown subject is then successfully authenticated. We evaluate our authentication models using data from N subjects. Our approach demonstrated an equal error rate of N \% immediately after training and N \% after about N months, in the worst case. In addition, we also explore the use of our approach for subjects with motor disabilities. The idea was to see if it can provide an easy-to-use authentication alternative for a population that lacks full independence in using their computing devices securely. People with motor disabilities have tremendous difficulty existing authentication solutions (e.g., passwords, fingerprint), to the extent that they have to rely on others to authenticate for them _cite_ . Using a separate dataset of N subjects with non-spastic cerebral palsy, our approach demonstrated a worst-case equal error rate of N \% after training and N \% after about N months. In this paper, we specifically use a Smart Eyewear (SEW) device (Google Glass _cite_) as our head-mounted wearable device. We chose to use an SEW device because of its relative ubiquity and easy programmability compared to other head-mounted wearable devices. Note that our work is generalizable to any head-mounted wearable device and is in no way limited to SEW devices or to Google Glass. The {\bf contributions} of this paper are then three-fold. (a) A passive authentication approach that uses BCG derived from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements of subtle and involuntary head movements. (b) Demonstration of the viability of this authentication approach measurements collected from N able-bodied subjects over the course of approximately N months. (c) Demonstration of the promise of our authentication approach for people with motor disabilities, using measurements from N subjects with cerebral palsy over approximately N months.
