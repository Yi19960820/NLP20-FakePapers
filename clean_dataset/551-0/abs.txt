This article presents a multiscale patch based convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-modality ND MR images. We use multiscale deep supervision and inputs to train a convolutional network. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the BRATS N segmentation challenge _cite_ where we obtained dice scores of N, N, N and N \% Hausdorff distance of N, N, and N for enhanced tumor core, whole tumor and tumor core respectively.
