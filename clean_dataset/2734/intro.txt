{Attention!!! There was a mistake of one-class SVM for salient object detection in the previous vision since the kernel trik is used for the training phrase only.} Salient object detection, deriving from classical human fixation prediction~ _cite_, to separate the entire salient object (s) that attract most of humans' attention in the scene from the background~ _cite_ . Driven by applications of saliency detection in computer vision, such as content-aware image resizing~ _cite_ and photo collection visualization~ _cite_, many computational models have been proposed in the past decade. There are two main motivations behind this paper. On one hand, recent advances in supervised salient object detection has resulted in significant performance on benchmark datasets~ _cite_ . Yet it is time consuming and tedious to annotate salient objects in order to train a model. On the other hand, it is usually assumed that at least one salient object exists in the input image by most existing salient object detection algorithms (See~ _cite_) . However, as shown in~, there exist background images ~ _cite_, where there are no salient objects at all. Based on this impractical assumption, all of three state-of-the-art approaches _cite_ produce inferior saliency maps on background images. To this end, we study how to utilize weakly labeled data to train salient object detection models. Given a set of background images and salient object images, where we only have annotations of salient object existence labels, our goal is to train a salient object detection model. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised learning approach to jointly deal with salient object existence and detection problems. The input image is first segmented into a set of superpixels . Saliency labels of superpixels (\ie, foreground or background) are then modeled as hidden variables in the latent structural SVM framework, where the inference can be efficiently solved using the graph cut algorithm~ _cite_ . The training problem is built upon the large-margin learning framework to separate the salient object images and the background images. Our proposed weakly supervised approach is based on a set of unsupervised methods _cite_ . Compared with supervised approaches, we do not require strong pixel-wise salient object annotations. Furthermore, our approach is capable of recognizing the existence of salient objects. Our main contributions therefore are two folds: (_inline_eq_) we propose a weakly supervised learning approach based on the latent structuralSVM framework, instead of expensive salient object annotations; (_inline_eq_) compared with conventional approaches, our proposed approach is capable of jointly addressing salient object existence and detection problems. Our approach performs better than most of unsupervised salient object detection models and is comparable with the best supervised approach.
