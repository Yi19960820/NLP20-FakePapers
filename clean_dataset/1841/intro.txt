White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are brain areas in the cerebral white matter with increased signal intensity on TN-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. are commonly found in the brain of healthy elders and patients diagnosed with small vessel disease and other neurological disorders~ _cite_ . Accurate quantification of WMH volume, location and shape is of great for tracking disease progression and evaluating treatment effects. Thus, a reliable and efficient WMH segmentation and quantification method is highly . Due to the nature and high intra-and inter-observer variability of WMH manual delineation, several automated, and non deep learning, methods have been in the literature~ _cite_ . However, none of the methods achieves . Major challenges for WMH segmentation include: (see Fig.~ _ref_) . The presence of other brain anatomies or diseases with enhanced intensities on FLAIR image adds further difficulties. Deep neural networks have achieved great success in both natural and medical image domains~ _cite_ . the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) ~ _cite_ architecture is an efficient option, with U-Net~ _cite_ prominently succeeding in segmenting finer scale objects by integrating shortcuts from stages in the downsampling path to the corresponding stage in the upsampling path. deep residual network (ResNets) ~ _cite_ have been shown to be effective. be quite beneficial for training deep networks with limited data in the medical imaging domain. for WMH segmentation. For instance, Ghafoorian et al.~ _cite_ have recently reported different fusion strategies to segment WMHs in a patch-based manner. However, their method has not been comprehensively evaluated and patch-based object segmentation is often not as efficient as FCNs. In this paper, we present a customized U-Net FCN with residual connections,, to segment WHM by using combined TN and FLAIR images. We demonstrate that the additional residual connections help to capture more fine-scale WMHs while reducing false positives. Furthermore, combining FLAIR and TN images helps the network learn a more robust WMH segmentation.
