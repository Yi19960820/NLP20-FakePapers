Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are an influential tool for solving various problems in the machine learning and computer vision fields. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning model called an Inception-Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (IRCNN), which utilizes the power of an inception network combined with recurrent layers in DCNN architecture. We have empirically evaluated the recognition performance of the proposed IRCNN model using different benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-N, CIFAR-N, and SVHN. Experimental results show similar or higher recognition accuracy when compared to most of the popular DCNNs including the RCNN. Furthermore, we have investigated IRCNN performance against equivalent Inception Networks and Inception-Residual Networks using the CIFAR-N dataset. We report about N \%, N \% and N \% improvement in classification accuracy when compared to the RCNN, equivalent Inception Networks, and Inception-Residual Networks on the augmented CIFAR-N dataset respectively.
