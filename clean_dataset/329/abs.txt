Despite recent success on ND human pose estimation, ND human pose estimation still remains an open problem. A key challenge is the ill-posed depth ambiguity nature. This paper presents a novel intermediate feature representation named skeleton map for regression. It distills structural context from irrelavant properties of RGB image _inline_eq_ illumination and texture. It is simple, clean and can be easily generated via deconvolution network. For the first time, we show that training regression network from skeleton map alone is capable of meeting the performance of state-of-the-art ND human pose estimation works. We further exploit the power of multiple ND hypothesis generation to obtain reasonbale ND pose in consistent with ND pose detection. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on challenging in-the-wild dataset MPII and indoor dataset N
