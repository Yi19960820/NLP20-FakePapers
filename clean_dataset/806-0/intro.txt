Image signals are often corrupted due to noise. Removing noise from image is an important issue in computer vision, because this step could be the preprocessing step of many other applications. Up to now various methods have been proposed to remove noise (denoise) from visual data. Focus of many of these methods is on Fourier Analysis [N], Spatial Filtering [N], and Wavelet Transform [N] . Also there are some other methods based on Spare Coding and Dictionary Learning [N] . On the other hand, Machine Learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been used in several papers to tackle this issue [N] [N] . One of the biggest difficulties in training such deep networks is that the cost function of such deep architectures gets stuck in poor local optima due to random initialization of weights. Hinton et al. [N] proposed a new greedy layer-wise algorithm to tackle this issue and introduced Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) . DBNs are able to present a good "feature" representation of data. These features which are defined as the properties of input data are presented as nodes of the last layer of DBN. As a result, in this paper we train a DBN such that it learns to extract image features. The trained DBN distinguishes between "noise features" and "clean image features" in the last layer and presents them into two distinct groups of nodes. Furthermore, DBNs are capable of reconstructing the input data based on the values of last layer nodes. Subsequently, if we eliminate the effects of nodes presenting the noise, the reconstructed image will be noiseless. From now on, we called the nodes presenting noise and the nodes presenting image content ``noise nodes" and ``image nodes", respectively. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section N we briefly describe Deep Learning. In Section N we describe the learning process. Section N is our experimental results and finally, we conclude the paper in Section N.
