Recently, Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) obtained huge success in numerous vision tasks. In particular, DenseNets have demonstrated that feature reuse via dense skip connections can effectively alleviate the difficulty of training very deep networks {and that reusing features generated by the {initial layers} in all subsequent layers has {strong} impact on performance. To feed even richer information into the network, a novel {adaptive} Multi-scale Convolution Aggregation module is presented in this paper.} Composed of layers for multi-scale convolutions, trainable cross-scale aggregation, maxout, and concatenation, this module is highly non-linear and can boost the accuracy of DenseNet while using much fewer parameters. In addition, due to {high} model complexity, the network with extremely dense feature reuse is prone to overfitting. {To address this problem,} a regularization method named Stochastic Feature Reuse is also presented. Through randomly dropping a set of feature maps to be reused for each mini-batch during the training phase, this regularization method reduces training costs and prevents co-adaptation. Experimental results on CIFAR-N, CIFAR-N and SVHN benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
