Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a coherent imaging technology that is capable of producing high resolution images of terrain and targets. SAR has the ability to operate at night and in adverse whether conditions, hence it can overcome limitations of the optical and infrared systems. However, SAR images are often contaminated by multiplication noise known as speckle _cite_ . Speckle is caused by the constructive and destructive interference of the coherent returns scattered by small reflectors within each resolution cell. The presence of speckle noise in SAR images can often make the processing and interpretation difficult for computer vision systems as well as human interpreters. Hence, it is important to remove speckle from SAR images to improve the performance of various computer vision algorithms such as segmentation, detection and recognition. Let _inline_eq_ be the observed image intensity, _inline_eq_ be the noise free image, and _inline_eq_ be the speckle noise. Then assuming that the SAR image is an average of _inline_eq_ looks, the observed image _inline_eq_ is related to _inline_eq_ by the following multiplicative model _cite_ where _inline_eq_ is the normalized fading speckle noise random variable. One common assumption on _inline_eq_ is that it follows a Gamma distribution with unit mean and variance _inline_eq_ and has the following probability density function _cite_ where _inline_eq_ denotes the Gamma function and _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ . Various methods have been developed in the literature to suppress speckle including multi-look processing _cite_, filtering methods _cite_, wavelet-based despecking methods _cite_, block-matching ND (BMND) algorithm _cite_ and Total Variation (TV) methods _cite_ . Note that some of these methods apply homomorphic processing in which the multiplicative noise is transformed into an additive noise by taking the logarithm of the observed data _cite_ . Furthermore, due to local processing nature of some of these methods, they often fail to preserve sharp features such as edges and often contain block artifacts in the denoised image. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various image processing tasks such are image restoration _cite_ and super resolution _cite_ . However, to the best of our knowledge, image despeckling methods based on deep learning have not been extensively studied in the literature. Motivated by recent advances in deep learning, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for image despeckling. Rather than using a homomorphic transformation _cite_, we directly estimate speckle using the input images based on the observation model . The proposed Image Despeckling Convolutional Neural Network (ID-CNN) method consists of several convolutional layers along with batch normalization _cite_ and rectified linear unit (ReLU) _cite_ activation function (see Figure~ _ref_) . In particular, the proposed architecture features a component-wise division-residual layer with skip-connection to estimate the denoised image. It is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a combination of Euclidean loss and Total Variation (TV) loss. One of the main advantages of using deep learning-based methods for image despeckling is that they learn parameters for image restoration directly from the training data rather than relying on pre-defined image priors or filters. Figure~ _ref_ shows a sample output from our ID-CNN method. Given the noisy image in Figure~ _ref_ (a), ID-CNN estimates the denoised image shown in Figure~ _ref_ (d) . The estimated speckle is also shown in Figure~ _ref_ (c) . As can be seen by comparing Figure~ _ref_ (b) and (d), one can see that out method is able to denoise the speckled image reasonably well.
