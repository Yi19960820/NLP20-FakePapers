Street addresses enhance precise physical presence and effectively increase the connectivity all around the world. Currently N \% of the roads in the world are not mapped~ _cite_, and this number is increasing in developing countries. United Nations claims to have N billion invisible people in the world due to the addressing problem in developing countries. This problem is even more critical in disaster zones, areas with limited resources, and geographically challenging locations. As the remote sensing technology has been significantly improving over the past decade, the organic growth of urban and suburban areas outruns the deployment of addressing schemes. We want to address the invisible. We imagine an algorithm that automatically creates meaningful addresses for unmapped areas, areas with no street name or address. In order to realize our goal, we designed and implemented a generative addressing system to bridge the gap between grid-based digital addressing schemes and traditional street addresses. We (i) design a physical addressing scheme, which is linear, hierarchical, flexible, intuitive, perceptible, robust, (ii) propose a segmentation method to obtain road segments and regions from satellite imagery, using deep learning and graph-partitioning, (iii) implement a labeling method to name urban elements based on current addressing schemes and distance fields, and (iv) develop ready-to-deploy prototype applications supporting forward and inverse geoqueries.
