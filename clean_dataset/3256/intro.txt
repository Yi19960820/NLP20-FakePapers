In the prevailing world, biometric traits used for identification of an individual, is the best possible user friendly, effective and efficient human identity management solution. Over the last few decades, many different biometric traits have been developed and explored extensively, such as face~ _cite_, iris~ _cite_, fingerprint~ _cite_, knuckle~ _cite_, palm~ _cite_, ear~ _cite_ _inline_eq_ . Due to the uniqueness of these biometric traits they have achieved similar performance with an improved user experience, as compared to other existing token/knowledge based alternatives and people have started using them in many places regarding their security concerns. Traditionally in many places where security is concerned, password and PIN based methods had been used in the past. In password based authentication systems, every person needs to remember his or her password. It has proved to be an efficient method (only up-to few passwords) but often leads to people forgetting their passwords. Also they are pretty easy to crack, which results in huge losses to individuals in terms of privacy as well as finance. Because of these limiting nature of password related security, biometric identification and authentication methods are preferred over traditional passwords and PIN based methods. The physical nature of the physiological biometric based identification, is the key to its secure trait, therefore it has grown to be a vast area of research in recent times. Any biometric based authentication system contains the following six modules, (i) Data acquisition, (ii) Region of Interest (ROI) extraction, (iii) Quality estimation, (iv) Data pre-processing (v) Feature extraction and finally (vi) Matching and fusion. Motivation: The ROI extraction is a very early step and one can easily infer that its performance plays a pivotal role in the overall system performance as all subsequent modules has to work over the region currently extracted. Several state of the art methods are available for the segmentation of any individual biometric trait. Since uni-modal systems performance got limited due to several external and environmental factors, researchers have moved to multi-modal biometric system, which uses combination of several traits for identification. Therefore a robust and efficient multi-modal biometric ROI extraction algorithm is necessarily required. Few example traits utilized are shown in Figure _ref_ . Related Work: Huge amount of work has already been done in order to segment individual biometric ROI. But to best of our knowledge no multi-modal ROI extraction has been reported till now. In ~ _cite_, four slap fingerprint segmentation has been performed by clustering and averaging pixel intensity of various non-overlapping boxes to localize the four fingerprints. Several iris segmentation methods has been discussed in ~ _cite_ . They mostly utilize circular hough transform or its variants for segmenting the inner circle. For segmenting the outer circle they applies the circular integro-differential operator. The face detection algorithm proposed by Viola and Jones~ _cite_, has been extensively used till date that uses a novel representation of images known as integral image and formulates a classifier using cascaded AdaBoost classifiers. Similarly, there are several knuckleprint ROI extraction algorithms such as the one presented in~ _cite_ and~ _cite_ . They have used curvature gabor filters to estimate the middle knuckle line and middle knuckle point. Finally, an area in accordance with the image size around the point has been considered. In~ _cite_, palm region has been extracting using similarity constraints such as thresholding and few spatial information. Contribution: The major contribution of our work is to provide a single fully automated network for biometric ROI extraction that can be trained and perform well for a vast variety of available biometric traits. In this paper, we have proposed an unified biometric ROI segmentation network (_inline_eq_), which can take input as any face, iris, palm, knuckle or four slap fingerprints image and provides the actual region of interest in that image as shown in Fig. _ref_ . Also, it can classify the extracted ROI into different biometric traits, so that it can later be matched with the appropriate gallery sample. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified deep learning architecture utilized to classify and localize any type of biometric sample. Justification for Model Selection: We have propose a method for region extraction using deep convolutional neural network. In traditional object detection and classification approaches, first image is passed through a region proposal algorithm or network (_inline_eq_), that returns multiple prospective candidate bounding boxes. These boxes are later given to a classifier for classification as an input. One example of such an approach is the Region based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) ~ _cite_, in which the region proposals are fed to a CNN classifier, but such models have very high time complexities with a good accuracy. Object Detection has also been performed as a single regression problem, as attempted in the case of YOLO~ _cite_ . Even though it is faster than RCNN, the issue with YOLO is that it several times it gives inaccurate results. Also its training requires more efforts and we have observed that in the case of biometric samples, its features are not very well transferable. Hence, we have selected a faster version of _inline_eq_ which gives much better accuracy as well as transferable features as compared with YOLO, named as Faster RCNN~ _cite_ . Rest of the paper has been organized as follows: Section N, explains in detail the proposed Deep CNN architecture. Section N, discuss the databases and testing protocol. Section N, provides the experimental results and Section N concludes the paper.
