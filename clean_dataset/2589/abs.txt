The inception network has been shown to provide good performance on image classification problems, but there are not much evidences that it is also effective for the image restoration or pixel-wise labeling problems. For image restoration problems, the pooling is generally not used because the decimated features are not helpful for the reconstruction of an image as the output. Moreover, most deep learning architectures for the restoration problems do not use dense prediction that need lots of training parameters. From these observations, for enjoying the performance of inception-like structure on the image based problems we propose a new convolutional network-in-network structure. The proposed network can be considered a modification of inception structure where pool projection and pooling layer are removed for maintaining the entire feature map size, and a larger kernel filter is added instead. Proposed network greatly reduces the number of parameters on account of removed dense prediction and pooling, which is an advantage, but may also reduce the receptive field in each layer. Hence, we add a larger kernel than the original inception structure for not increasing the depth of layers. The proposed structure is applied to typical image-to-image learning problems, i.e., the problems where the size of input and output are same such as skin detection, semantic segmentation, and compression artifacts reduction. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network brings comparable or better results than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for these problems.
