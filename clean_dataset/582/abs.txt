In this notebook paper, we describe our approach in the submission to the {\bf temporal action proposal (task N)} and {\bf temporal action localization (task N)} of ActivityNet Challenge hosted at CVPR N. Since the accuracy in action classification task is already very high (nearly _inline_eq_ in ActivityNet dataset), we believe that the main bottleneck for temporal action localization is the quality of action proposals. Therefore, we mainly focus on the temporal action proposal task and propose a new proposal model based on temporal convolutional network. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both temporal action proposal task and temporal action localization task.
