A wide range of computer vision applications rely on establishing point correspondences between images. These correspondences can be established densely for every pixel _cite_, but it is often of interest to instead establish only a sparse set of correspondences. A sparse set makes many algorithms, such as visual odometry or bundle adjustment, far more tractable, both in terms of computation and memory. Furthermore, in multi-agent scenarios, using a sparse set of points to represent an agent's observation means that less data needs to be exchanged. Typically, a set of interest points is first identified with a detector. However, only a fraction of these points will result in correct correspondences, as some of them will fail to be matched to points in the other image. Of the points that do match, some will further fail geometrical consistency, resulting in an even smaller set of inlier points. In this work, we seek to find the minimal set of points to extract in order to obtain a specific number of inliers {, as shown in for _inline_eq_ inliers} . While approaches exist to reduce an already given set of detected points _cite_, we focus instead on directly detecting a minimal set. To quantify this objective, we introduce the {\it _inline_eq_-succinctness} metric that builds on top of the widely used {\it matching score} _cite_ . The matching score indicates what fraction of a given set of points results in inliers, but it depends on the number of points extracted. In contrast, the _inline_eq_-succinctness metric answers the question of how many points need to be extracted with a given detector, and in the context of a given point matching algorithm, to yield a certain number _inline_eq_ of inliers. The scalar _inline_eq_ is a parameter of the metric, and depends on the application at hand. In our experiments, we consider PNP pose estimation _cite_ as an application. Given three ND reference points in the object frame and their corresponding ND projections, PNP determines four possible solutions for the orientation and position (pose) of a calibrated perspective camera _cite_ . A fourth point is needed to disambiguate between the four solutions. So theoretically, only four inliers are sufficient to establish a pose estimate, but we show experimentally that instead, choosing _inline_eq_ results in significantly better pose estimation performance. Alongside the succinctness metric, we propose a new, simple training methodology for interest point detectors. The network is simply trained to predict, for every pixel, the probability of resulting in an inlier, after being subjected to non-maxima suppression and descriptor matching. Furthermore, we show for the first time how an interest point detector can be trained without the necessity of provided correspondence labels or pre-calculated depths, but merely with KLT tracking. The proposed detector and other state-of-the-art detectors are evaluated with respect to succinctness on three datasets representing both indoor and outdoor scenes, and image pairs with narrow and wide baseline. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:
