Segmentation and delineation of the articulated topology of retinal vessel network and structural attributes of vessels such as thickness, run length, tortuosity and branching patterns provide first level pathological cue for identifying various cardiovascular and opthalmogic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerosis _cite_ . Automatic analysis of retinal vessel topography assists in developing robust screening systems for diabetic retinopathy _cite_, localizing of foveal avascular region _cite_, thinning of arteries _cite_ and laser surgery _cite_ . Vessel tortuosity embeds significant information about hypertensive retinopathy _cite_ while vessel diameter had been studied in connection with hypertension _cite_ . Besides clinical areas, retinal topography has also been used for biometric applications _cite_ . \par Related Works: Unsupervised paradigms of automatic vessel detection primarily aims at designing matched filters by convolving a Gaussian kernel or its derivatives to emphasize vessel regions _cite_ . Popular unsupervised multiscale approaches assign a `vesselness' metric based on eigen analysis of the Hessian _cite_ . Unsupervised model based techniques include active contour models and geometric model guided level sets _cite_ . Supervised models rely on feature extraction on manually annoted ground truth images followed by classification, usually using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) or their variants. Most common practise for feature extraction involves Gabor filter response at different strata of scale and degree _cite_ . Other notable feature extraction methods include orientation analysis of gradient vector field _cite_, line operators _cite_, ridge profiles _cite_ and modelling tissue-photon interactions _cite_ . \par Challenges and Mitigation Strategies: The aforementioned traditional methods rely on hand crafted low level visual features and are inept at automatically learning generalized features from training data. Designing such carefully formulated task specific features requires appreciable domain expertise. Recent paradigms of deep learning aim at unsupervised generalized feature extraction from the raw image data itself. Our work is primarily invigorated by the recent success of hierarchical feature extraction frameworks for retinal vessel segmentation _cite_ using deep neural networks. \par Contributions: We present an architecture which supports two parallel levels of ensembling of stacked denoised autoencoder (SDAE) networks. As shown in Fig. _ref_, first level of ensemble, also termed as "E _inline_eq_: Net", is formed by training _inline_eq_ parallel SDAE networks (of same architecture) on booststrap samples while second level ensemble (Fig. _ref_) is realized by parallel training of two "E _inline_eq_: Net"s of different architecture. Initial architecture of any deep network is usually intuitive and needs to be fine tuned based on classification accuracy. We explore the possibility of leveraging performance of different architectured networks within the context of ensemble learning. We study various techniques for combining decisions of individual members of the ensemble and we show that using only simple SoftMax classifier we outperform the recent deep learning based method _cite_ which uses random forest classifier after unsupervised feature extraction. For mitigating class imbalance between vessel and background, we present a set of smart sampling procedures for creating a database congenial for training SDAE. \par The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The problem statement is formally defined in \S II and the detailed solution is presented in \S III. In Section \S IV we validate and compare our results with state-of-the-art vessel segmentation algorithms. Finally, we conclude the paper in \S V with a summary of aptness of our ensemble learning of deep networks for automatically generating diversified dictionary kernels for medical image analysis.
