We propose a deep feature-based face detector for mobile devices to detect user's face acquired by the front-facing camera. The proposed method is able to detect faces in images containing extreme pose and illumination variations as well as partial faces. The main challenge in developing deep feature-based algorithms for mobile devices is the constrained nature of the mobile platform and the non-availability of CUDA enabled GPUs on such devices. Our implementation takes into account the special nature of the images captured by the front-facing camera of mobile devices and exploits the GPUs present in mobile devices without CUDA-based frameworks, to meet these challenges.
