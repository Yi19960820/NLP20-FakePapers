Feature representation and metric learning are two critical components in person re-identification models. In this paper, we focus on the feature representation and claim that hand-crafted histogram features can be complementary to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. We propose a novel feature extraction model called Feature Fusion Net (FFN) for pedestrian image representation. In FFN, back propagation makes CNN features constrained by the hand-crafted features. Utilizing color histogram features (RGB, HSV, YCbCr, Lab and YIQ) and texture features (multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor features), we get a new deep feature representation that is more discriminative and compact. Experiments on three challenging datasets (VIPeR, CUHKN, PRIDNs) validates the effectiveness of our proposal.
