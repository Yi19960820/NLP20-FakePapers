Medical ultrasound is a wide-spread imaging modality due to its high temporal resolution, lack of harmful radiation and cost-effectiveness, which distinguishes it from other modalities such as MRI and CT. High frame rate ultrasound is highly desirable for the functional analysis of rapidly moving organs, such as the heart. For a given angular sector size and acquisition depth, the frame rate is limited by the speed of sound in soft tissues (about _inline_eq_ m/s) . The frame rate depends on the number of transmitted beams needed to cover the field of view; thus, it can be increased by lowering the number of the transmitted events. One such method termed (MLA) or (PRB) employs a smaller number of wide beams in the transmission, and constructs a multiple numbers of beams in the reception _cite_, _cite_ . The drawbacks of the method include block-like artifacts in images, reduced lateral resolution, and reduced contrast _cite_ . Another high frame-rate method, (MLT), employs a simultaneous transmissions of a multiple number of narrow beams focused in different directions _cite_, _cite_ . Recently reinvented, this method suffers from a high energy content due to the simultaneous transmissions _cite_, and from cross-talk artifacts on both the transmit and receive, caused by the interaction between the beams _cite_, _cite_ . Over the years, numerous methods were proposed to deal with those artifacts, including constant _cite_, _cite_ and adaptive _cite_, _cite_ apodizations, by allocating different frequency bands to different transmissions _cite_, _cite_, and by using a tissue harmonic mode _cite_ . The filtered delay-multiply-and-sum beamforming (F-DMAS) _cite_ was proposed in the context of MLT in _cite_, demonstrating better artifact rejection, higher contrast ratio (CR) and lateral resolution compared to MLT beamformed with delay-and-sum (DAS) and Tukey apodization on receive, at expense of lower contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) . Finally, short-lag F-DMAS for MLT was studied in _cite_, demonstrating a contrast improvement for higher maximum-lag values, and resolution and speckle-signal-to-noise ratio (sSNR) improvements for lower lag values, at the expense of decreased MLT cross-talk artifact rejection. By using a simulated _inline_eq_ MLT, it was demonstrated in _cite_ that the tissue harmonic imaging mode provides images with a lower transmit cross-talk artifact as compared to the fundamental harmonic imaging. However, the receive cross-talk artifact still requires correction. In the present study, we demonstrate that similarly to the fundamental harmonic, the cross-talk is more severe in the tissue harmonic mode for higher MLT configurations, which is manifested by a lower contrast. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were introduced for the processing of ultrasound acquired data in order to generate a high quality plane wave compounding with a reduced number of transmissions _cite_ as well as for fast despeckling, and CT-quality image generation _cite_ during the post-processing stage. In a parallel effort, _cite_ demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs in improving MLA quality in ultrasound imaging. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to use CNN in MLT ultrasound imaging. Contributions. In this work, we propose an end-to-end CNN-based approach for MLT artifact correction. We train a convolutional neural network consisting of an encoder-decoder architecture followed by a constant apodization layer. The network is trained with dynamically focused element-wise data obtained from {} scans in an simulated MLT configuration with the objective to approximate the corresponding single-line transmission (SLT) mode. We demonstrate the performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively using metrics such as CR and CNR. Finally, we validate that the trained model generalizes well to different patients, different anatomies, as well as to phantom data.
