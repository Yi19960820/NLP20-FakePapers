Person re-identification (Re-ID) is of increasing importance in visual surveillance. The goal of person Re-ID is to identify a specific person indicated by a probe image from a set of gallery images captured from cross-view cameras (i.e., cameras that are non-overlapping and different from the probe image's camera) ~ _cite_ . It remains challenging due to the large appearance changes in different camera views and the interferences from background or object occlusion. One major challenge for person Re-ID is the uncontrolled spatial misalignment between images due to camera-view changes or human-pose variations. For example, in Fig.~ _ref_, the green patch located in the lower part in camera _inline_eq_ 's image corresponds to patches from the upper part in camera _inline_eq_ 's image. However, most existing works _cite_ focus on handling the overall appearance variations between images, while the spatial misalignment among images' local patches is not addressed. Although some patch-based methods _cite_ address the spatial misalignment problem by decomposing images into patches and performing an online patch-level matching, their performances are often restrained by the online matching process which is easily affected by the mismatched patches due to similar appearance or occlusion. In this paper, we argue that due to the stable setting of most cameras (e.g., fixed camera angle or location), each camera has a stable constraint on the spatial configuration of its captured images. For example, images in Fig.~ _ref_ and~ _ref_ are obtained from the same camera pair: _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ . Due to the constraint from camera angle difference, body parts in camera _inline_eq_ 's images are located at lower places than those in camera _inline_eq_, implying a lower-to-upper correspondence pattern between them. Meanwhile, constraints from camera locations can also be observed. Camera _inline_eq_ (which monitors an exit region) includes more side-view images, while camera _inline_eq_ (monitoring a road) shows more front or back-view images. This further results in a high probability of side-to-front/back correspondence pattern. Based on this intuition, we propose to learn a correspondence structure (i.e., a matrix including patch-wise matching probabilities between a camera pair, as Fig.~ _ref_) to encode the spatial correspondence pattern constrained by a camera pair, and utilize it to guide the patch matching and matching score calculation processes between images. With this correspondence structure, spatial misalignments can be suitably handled and patch matching results are less interfered by the confusion from appearance or occlusion. In order to model human-pose variations or local viewpoint changes inside a camera view, the correspondence structure for each patch is described by a one-to-many graph whose weights indicate the matching probabilities between patches, as in Fig.~ _ref_ . Besides, a global constraint is also integrated during the patch matching process, so as to achieve a more reliable matching score between images. Moreover, since people often show different poses inside a camera view, the spatial correspondence pattern between a camera pair may be further divided and modeled by a set of sub-patterns according to these pose variations (e.g., Fig.~ _ref_ can be divided into a left-to-front correspondence sub-pattern and a right-to-back correspondence sub-pattern) . Therefore, we further extend our approach by introducing a set of local correspondence structures to capture various correspondence sub-patterns between a camera pair. In this way, the spatial misalignments between individual images can be modeled and handled in a more precise way. In summary, our contributions to Re-ID are four folds. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section~ _ref_ reviews related works. Section~ _ref_ describes the framework of the proposed approach. Sections~ _ref_ to~ _ref_ describe the details of our proposed global constraint-based matching process and boosting-based learning approach, respectively. Section~ _ref_ describes the details of extending our approach with multi-structure scheme. Section~ _ref_ shows the experimental results and Section~ _ref_ concludes the paper.
