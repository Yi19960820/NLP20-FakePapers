As the generalization of the graph model~ _cite_, the hypergraph model is more flexible and more intuitive to depict the complex relation of data, since the edge of hypergraph, which is known as the hyperedge, can contain more than two vertices. Due to this desirable property, hypergraph learning is recently drawn intensive attention. Over past decades, extensive hypergraph learning approaches has been proposed and successfully applied to tackle a lot of fundamental tasks, such as clustering~ _cite_, classification~ _cite_, segmentation~ _cite_, dimensionality reduction~ _cite_ and multi-label learning~ _cite_ . As same as graph learning, the hypergraph construction process plays a vital role in hypergraph learning and a good quality hypergraph should well reveal the real relation of samples. Hypergraph learning is a frequently used tool for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In these two cases, the previous hypergraph learning works often adopt the neighbourhood-based (distance-based) strategy to build the hypergraph~ _cite_ . More specifically, for each sample, a hyperedge is generated by connecting this centroid sample and its _inline_eq_ nearest neighbors. However, as such neighborhood-based often cannot well even correctly discover the real relations of samples and it is also very sensitive to noises, the quality of hypergraph is lowered which directly degrades the performance of hypergraph learning. In the recent decade, Sparse Representation (SR) has achieved remarkable successes for addressing dozens of computer vision and machine learning issues~ _cite_ . The main merits of SR are the strong discriminating power and the excellent robustness to noises which endow SR with a better related sample selection capacity for a given sample in comparison with the conventional neighborhood-based approaches (We refer to an toy example in our early work~ _cite_ to experimentally verify this argument, please see Fig~ _ref_) . In other words, SR can better discover the real relations of data. Motivated by this fact, several novel graph learning approaches have been developed via leveraging SR to construct the graphs~ _cite_ . Compared to the traditional graph learning approaches, these works have achieved better performances. Since the hypergraph model is the generalization of the graph model and hypergraph learning is closely related to graph learning, we believe that the success of SR in graph learning should also be applied to hypergraph learning. Moreover, SR is essentially a _inline_eq_ or _inline_eq_-norm regularized regression model and its success also motivates the presentations of many influential regression models which often enjoy some desirable properties~ _cite_ . Cleary, these successful works can also provide some new ways for graph or hypergraph construction. In this paper, we generalize the idea of sparse graph to present a novel hypergraph construction framework, which can leverage the regression model to construct the high quality hypergraph. We name such framework Regression-based Hypergraph (RH) model. More specifically, in RH, each sample represents a vertex and constructs a regression system together with the rest samples for measuring correlations of samples. Then, based on the obtained correlations, each sample and its top _inline_eq_ most relevant samples are employed to define a hyperedge. Moreover, the mean of the correlations among samples in a hyperedge is considered as the weight of this hyperedge, since the correlation is an intuitive measure of the closeness between two samples. We also plug the regression-based hypergraph into two classical hypergraph learning frameworks, namely hypergraph spectral clustering and hypergraph transduction, to present Regression-based Hypergraph Spectral Clustering (RHSC) and Regression-based Hypergraph Transduction (RHT) models for addressing the clustering and classification issues. As two of the most influential regression models for visual learning, Sparse Representation (SR) and Collaborative Representation (CR) are adopted as two examples to instantiate two RH instances. Since SR and CR are actually the _inline_eq_-norm and _inline_eq_-norm regularized regression models, we name these two instances _inline_eq_-Hypergraph (_inline_eq_ H) and _inline_eq_-Hypergraph (_inline_eq_ H) respectively. Similarly, their hypergraph spectral clustering and hypergraph transduction algorithms are named as _inline_eq_-Hypergraph Spectral Clustering (_inline_eq_ HSC) and _inline_eq_-Hypergraph Transduction (_inline_eq_ HT) where _inline_eq_ or N if _inline_eq_ H or _inline_eq_ H is applied. Regression-based Hypergraph (RH) model inherits the advantages of both hypergraph and regression models. Compared to the conventional hypergraph models, RH can incorporate some properties from the chosen regression models. For example, if the Sparse Representation (SR) or Collaborative Representation (CR) is selected for hypergraph construction, the constructed RH should be more discriminative and robust, since these two regression models are better to discover the relevances among samples over the conventional neighborhood-based hypergraph construction fashions. Compared to the regression approaches, RH constructs a hypergraph to sufficiently exploit the correlation of each pair of samples instead of just utilizing the correlations between the target sample and the other samples as the regression approaches do. Compared to the regression-based graph approaches, such as the sparse graph, RH is a hypergraph model which owns a better capability and flexibility to depict the complex high-order data relations. We employ six popular visual databases to validate our works. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the RH model over the conventional hypergraph models. We conclude three main contributions of our works as follows: The rest of paper is organized as follows: the previous works are reviewed in Section~ _ref_ .
