Single image non-blind deconvolution aims to recover a sharp latent image given a blurred image and the blur kernel. The community has made active research effort on this classical problem with the last decade. Assuming the camera motion is spatially invariant, a blurred image _inline_eq_ can be modeled as a convolution between a blur kernel _inline_eq_ and a latent image _inline_eq_: where _inline_eq_ is additive noise and _inline_eq_ is the convolution operator. In non-blind deconvolution, we solve _inline_eq_ from _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_, which is an ill-posed problem since the noise is unknown. Conventional approaches, such as the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution~ _cite_ and the Wiener filter~ _cite_, suffer from serious ringing artifacts and are less effective to deal with large motion and outliers. Several methods focus on developing effective image priors for image restoration, including Hyper-Laplacian priors~ _cite_, non-local means~ _cite_, field of experts~ _cite_, patch-based priors~ _cite_ and shrinkage fields~ _cite_ . However, these image priors are heavily based on the empirical statistics of natural images. In addition, these image priors typically lead to highly non-convex optimization problems. Most of the aforementioned methods need expensive computational costs to obtain state-of-the-art deblurred results. Recently, the deep neural network has been applied to image restoration~ _cite_ . However, these methods need to re-train the network for different blur kernels, which is not practical in real-world scenarios. Different from existing methods, we propose a FCNN for iterative non-blind deconvolution, which is able to automatically learn effective image prior and does not need to re-train the network for different blur kernels. The proposed method decomposes the non-blind deconvolution into two steps: image denoising and image deconvolution. In the image denoising step, we train a FCNN to remove noises and outliers in the domain. The learned image gradients are treated as image priors to guide the image deconvolution. In the image deconvolution step, we concatenate a deconvolution module at the end of the FCNN to remove the blur from input images. We cascade the FCNN into a multi-stage architecture to deconvolve blurred images iteratively. The proposed FCNN adaptively learns effective image priors to preserve image details and structures. In order to effectively suppress ringing artifacts and noises in the smooth regions, we propose to optimize the FCNN with a robust _inline_eq_ loss function instead of a commonly used _inline_eq_ loss function. In addition, we optimize the hyper-parameters in the deconvolution modules. Extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of quality and speed.
