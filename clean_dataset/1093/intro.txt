The ubiquitous use of mobile phone cameras in the recent decade has set a very high demand on the image quality these devices are expected to produce. On the other hand, the never-ending pursuit of more pixels at smaller form factors puts stringent constraints on the amount of light each pixel is exposed to and results in noisier images. This puts an increasing weight on computational post-processing techniques, in particular on image denoising. Many image acquisition artifacts such as low-light noise and camera shake _cite_ can be compensated by image enhancemnet techniques. Denoising in the presense of additive white Gaussian noise is one of the key problems studied in this context. While realistic low-light imaging is largely dominated by the Poisson-distributed shot noise, there exist various techniques that allow accurate treatment of non-Gaussian noise sources with a Gaussian denoiser _cite_ . Moreover, it has been shown in _cite_ that having a good Gaussian denoising algorithm allows to solve efficiently many other image processing problems such as deblurring, inpainting, compression postprocessing and more, without compromising the reconstruction quality or the need to design a new strategy adapted to a new setting. In view of these results, it is evident that a good Gaussian denoiser sets the foundation for solving a variety of image reconstruction and enhancement problems. Numerous methods have been proposed for removing Gaussian noise from images, including _inline_eq_-SVD _cite_, non-local means _cite_, BMND _cite_ non-local _inline_eq_-SVD _cite_, field of experts (FoE) _cite_, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) _cite_, non-local Bayes _cite_, nonlocally centralized sparse representation (NCSR) _cite_ and simultaneous sparse coding combined with Gaussian scale mixture (SSC-GSM) _cite_ . These techniques have been designed based on some properties of natural images such as the recurrence of patches at different locations or their sparsity in a certain dictionary. In the past few years, the state-of-the-art in image denoising has been achieved by techniques based on artificial neural networks _cite_ . Neural networks (NNs) are essentially concatenations of basic units (layers), each comprising a linear operation followed by a simple non-linearity, resulting in an intricate highly non-linear response. Currently, they are among the most popular and powerful tools in machine learning _cite_ . NN-based approaches have led to state-of-the-art results in numerous tasks in computer vision (e.g. for image classification _cite_, video classification _cite_, object detection _cite_, face recognition _cite_, and handwriting word recognition _cite_), speech recognition _cite_ and natural language processing _cite_, artificial intelligence (e.g., playing videogames _cite_ or beating the world Go champion _cite_, which is considered to be a very prominent milestone in the AI community), medical imaging _cite_, image processing (e.g., image decovolution _cite_, inpainting _cite_ and super-resolution _cite_), and more _cite_ . The first neural network to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image denoising has been proposed in _cite_ . It is based on a fully connected architecture and therefore requires more training examples at training and much more memory and arithmetic complexity at inference compared to the more recent solution in _cite_, which proposes a neural network based on a deep Gaussian Conditional Random Field (DGCRF) model, or the model-based Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion (TNRD) network introduced in _cite_ . \subsection* {Contribution} One of the main elements we find to be missing in the current denosing techniques (and image enhancement strategies in general) is the awareness of the class of images being processed. Such an approach is much needed as the objects typically photographed by phone camera users belong to a limited number of semantic classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to do better image enhancement when the algorithm is . We demonstrate this claim on the Gaussian denoising task, for which we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture that obtains performance higher than or comparable to the state-of-the-art. The advantage of our architecture is its simple design and the ease of adaptation to new data. We fine-tune a pretrained network on several popular image classes and demonstrate a further significant improvement in performance compared to the class-agnostic baseline. In light of the high performance achieved by modern image classification schemes, the proposed techniqe may be used to improve the image quality in mobile phone camera. To substantiate this claim, we show that the state-of-the-art image classification networks are resilient to the presence of even large amounts of noise.
