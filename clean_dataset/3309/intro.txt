Remote sensing has benefited a lot from deep learning in the past few years, mainly thanks to progress achieved in the computer vision community on natural RGB images. Indeed, most deep learning architectures designed for multimedia vision can be used on remote sensing optical images. This resulted in significant improvements in many remote sensing tasks such as vehicle detection~ _cite_, semantic labeling~ _cite_ and land cover/use classification~ _cite_ . However, these improvements have been mostly restrained to traditional N-channels RGB images that are the main focus of the computer vision community. On the other hand, Earth Observation data is rarely limited to this kind of optical sensor. Additional data, either from the same sensor (e.g. multispectral data) or from another one (e.g. a Lidar point cloud) is sometimes available. However, adapting vision-based deep networks to these larger data is not trivial, as this requires to work with new data structures that do not share the same underlying physical and numerical properties. Nonetheless, all these sources provide complementary information that should be used jointly to maximize the labeling accuracy. In this work we present how to build a comprehensive deep learning model to leverage multi-modal high-resolution remote sensing data, with the example of semantic labeling of Lidar and multispectral data over urban areas. Our contributions are the following:
