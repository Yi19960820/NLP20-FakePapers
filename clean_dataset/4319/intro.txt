Towards natural human-computer interaction, the emergence of smartphones has changed our lives and made our lives more convenient. The interaction between people and mobile phones are through the touch screen, camera and microphone. However, due to environmental constraints, these interaction methods suffer from many uncontrollable problems. For example, the video based methods do not work well in the night time. Nowadays, inertial sensors including accelerometer and gyrometer are built in smartphones _cite_, which can record the signal of hand movements when their devices are in use. Therefore, gesture action using inertial sensors can be easily achieved and understood _cite_ . Different from computer vision based gesture recognition, the requirements for gesture recognition based on inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer) are much simpler \; _cite_ . However, the mobile gesture recognition inevitably encounters several external variations including signal intensity differences (intense versus weak gestures), temporal variations (slow versus fast movements) and physical differences (users' physical conditions, etc.) . In addition, the noise caused by the hardware device also has a severe impact on the recognition performance. Support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW) have been introduced to solve the problems mentioned above. Recently, deep learning methods have significantly push the state-of-the-art in human activity recognition. They avoid feature engineering and are able to learn data representations and classifiers simultaneously. Among those, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \; _cite_ are popular sequential modelling methods. They have been successfully applied to many fields such as language modeling \; _cite_, image captioning \; _cite_, video analysis \; _cite_ and ND action recognition \; _cite_ . These methods can also be utilized to solve our problem, since the mobile gesture signals are sequential data streams of inertial sensors \; _cite_ . The publicly available databases are very important to researchers for algorithm development and evaluation. However, most of the previous works in the field of mobile gesture recognition were conducted with self-prepared data. And few databases related to mobile gesture recognition are publicly available. In this paper, we first introduce a mobile based gesture recognition benchmark, which can help researchers to evaluate and compare their algorithms by using the same gesture data. The database was collected based on N participants (N males and N females), consisting N gestures of N repetitions. Two Fisher discriminative deep models termed F-BLSTM and a variant F-BGRU are proposed for hand gesture recognition on mobile devices. The Fisher criterion which minimizes the {intra-class variations and maximize inter-class variations} is incorporated into softmax loss of LSTM, leading a better classification ability to cope with external variations. The flowchart of the gesture recognition approach is shown in Fig. \; _ref_ . In summary, we make the following contributions: The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \; _ref_ introduces the related works, and Section \; _ref_ describes the details of the proposed method. Experiments and results are presented in Section \; _ref_ . Finally, Section \; _ref_ concludes the paper.
