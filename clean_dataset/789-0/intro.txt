Past few years noted increased activity in the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for a variety of classical computer vision problems. The initial breakthroughs were enabled by the availability of large datasets (ImageNet, Places) yielding dramatic improvements on the object and scene classification task~ _cite_ . Since this initial success several strategies have been explored to adapt the network parameters or architecture to other tasks~ _cite_ . Typical convolutional neural networks used for categorization tasks are often concatenations of multiple convolution and pooling layers followed by two or three fully connected layers and a soft-max classifier. It has been demonstrated in _cite_ that using last fully connected layer features (fcN) from pre-trained CNNs _cite_ as a representation, is suitable for linear classifiers such as SVM, leads to superior performance on a variety of classification tasks. More comprehensive study of transferability of representations of features derived from CNN's to different tasks can be found in~ _cite_ . In this paper, instead of exploiting the features from fully connected layers as image representation for the categorization and image retrieval tasks, we propose significantly more efficient, compact, and more discriminant representation and associated pooling strategy. Using CNNs pre-trained on {\em Places} _cite_ and {\em ImageNet} ~ _cite_ we consider the feature maps computed at the last pooling layer N before the fully connected layers. We demonstrate that these features are more effective in retrieving instances of the same objects under dramatic variations of viewpoint and scale as encountered in INRIA Holiday dataset and show how different pooling strategies affect this capability. More recently the effectiveness of max and average pooling strategies was also investigated in~ _cite_ in the context of image retrieval task. Related to the insights obtained previously, we propose additional hybrid pooling strategy, provide detail visualization of the effects of the pooling strategies and their dependence on clutter and viewpoint. This is supported by recent strategies for visualization of network layers as well as ablation studies presented in~ _cite_ . The intuition behind the effectiveness of our approach is that in the layers before last fully connected layers the encoded information is more semantically meaningful and spatially localized. At last we introduce and evaluate the retrieval accuracy on a new challenging GeoPlacesNK dataset containing images of different geographic locations taken at different times of day, with dramatic variations of viewpoints. The overview of our method is shown in Figure~ _ref_ . In addition to the image retrieval task we also evaluate the proposed strategy on SUNN scene categorization dataset achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art more efficiently and with order of magnitude smaller memory footprint.
