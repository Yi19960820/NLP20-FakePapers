Cardiovascular disease (CV) remains the leading cause of death worldwide _cite_ . Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is frequently used for diagnostics of various cardiac diseases _cite_ . Segmentation of the Left Ventricle (LV) from CMR images provides a standard procedure for the determination of cardiac parameters which is time-consuming and requires relevant experience. The segmentation of the heart requires the identification of two anatomical regions: the inner part called the endocardium, and the outer part, the epicardium. Identifying and segmenting those two regions in CMR images presents different levels of difficulty: while the endocardium has sufficient contrast, the epicardial surface presents profiles of intensity with little contrast _cite_ . Notwithstanding, a clear delineation of the epicardium contours is a challenging task due to non-homogeneity in the blood flow. Moreover, the presence of strong unevenness on the wall in the interior of the heart chambers due to the sporadic presence of papillary muscles does not allow a clear delimitation of the endocardial wall _cite_ . The level of difficulty also depends on the particular ventricular section; the apical and basal sections are much more difficult to segment because of the resolution of the image is lower and does not allow the detection of ventricular structure _cite_ . Fully automatic segmentation algorithms have been proposed in the last decade to speed up segmentation, but the robust and reliable solution is still missing for clinical practice _cite_ . Existing approaches for fully-automated LV segmentation can be divided into three groups: image-based methods, deformable models, and pixel-based classification methods. Image-based methods consist of finding the endocardium border using a threshold of gray level intensities _cite_ or Dynamic Programming (DP) _cite_ . The Level-Set (LS) segmentation, such as _cite_, is the most successful choice within the methods using deformable models. Finally, pixel classification methods, based on supervised Deep Neural Networks _cite_, have become relatively successful for both object detection and segmentation. Proposed architectures include Fully Convolution Neural Networks (FCNN) _cite_, Stacked Autoencoders (SA) _cite_ and Deep Belief Networks _cite_ . Occasionally, a post-processing method is also applied, following the initial segmentation, to obtain more robust and accurate contours. In some cases, a single architecture trained end-to-end has been shown to achieve satisfactory performance without the need for further pre-and post-processing, e.g. by modeling the spatial dependence amongst SA sections _cite_ . There are also architectures for segmentation of three-dimensional images, such as _cite_, which have shown to boost the performance of ND approaches _cite_ . Also, Optical Flow (OP), i.e. the pattern of apparent motion of objects, has also been used in the segmentation context to exploit the regularity in the cardiac motion and constrain the degree of allowed LV movement between adjacent image frames. Indeed, OP equations have also been combined with the LS equations to enforce visual constancy _cite_ . In this work, we exploit a complementary source of information, the coherence across consecutive frames, and propose a Temporal Convolution Neural Network (T-FCNN) architecture with Semantic Flow post-processing. The performance of the proposed architecture is compared against an established FCNN model, which treats each cardiac phase independently and achieves good segmentation performance _cite_ . An alternative post-processing choice, the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) _cite_, is also investigated.
