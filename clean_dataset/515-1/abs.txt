In this work, we present a framework based on multi-stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for group activity recognition. Streams of CNNs are separately trained on different modalities and their predictions are fused at the end. Each stream has two branches to predict the group activity based on person and scene level representations. A new modality based on the human pose estimation is presented to add extra information to the model. We evaluate our method on the Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to achieve state-of-the-art results when multiple or single frames are given as input to the model with N \% and N \% accuracy on Volleyball dataset, respectively, and N \% accuracy of multiple frames group activity on Collective Activity dataset.
