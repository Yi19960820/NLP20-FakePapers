Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are playing important roles in state-of-the-art visual recognition. This paper focuses on modeling the spatial co-occurrence of neuron responses, which is less studied in the previous work. For this, we consider the neurons in the hidden layer as {\em neural words}, and construct a set of {\em geometric neural phrases} on top of them. The idea that grouping neural words into neural phrases is borrowed from the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model. Next, the {\bf Geometric Neural Phrase Pooling} (GNPP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently encode these neural phrases. GNPP acts as a new type of hidden layer, which punishes the isolated neuron responses after convolution, and can be inserted into a CNN model with little extra computational overhead. Experimental results show that GNPP produces significant and consistent accuracy gain in image classification.
