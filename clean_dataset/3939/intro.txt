Lane-change is a basic driving maneuver that moves the ego-vehicle into the adjacent lane heading the same direction. On the roadway, we often encounter situations to change lanes in order to avoid obstacles, overtake other vehicles, or merge into traffic. Before initiating lane-change, a driver must be aware of his/her surroundings to avoid crash or any other incident. For an inexperienced driver, it is a challenging task to simultaneously perceive traffic of the ego and adjacent lanes. Without concentration, even a skillful driver may cause undesired situations during lane-change. For safe lane-change decision aids, automakers have developed blind spot detection (BSD) systems . To observe the rear side space, automakers equip a vehicle with sensors such as cameras or high frequency radars. The BSD system tracks rear side traffic of the ego-vehicle and warns the driver if the system detects an object entering the blind spot zone. To make a safe lane-change, autonomous vehicles as well as human drivers generally perform the following steps: N) {\it environmental perception} and N) {\it maneuver decision making} . For the perception task, researchers attempt to identify driving-relevant objects on the roadway such as vehicles, lanes, and road markings. Specifically, significant progress has been made on computer vision based algorithms for object detection and tracking~ _cite_ . For an in-depth review of computer vision applications for intelligent vehicles, we refer the reader to~ _cite_ . In spite of these advances in computer vision algorithms, the use of them may be inadequate for real time applications such as lane-change problem, because there are too many object classes that need to be detected and tracked in street scenes, \eg cars, fence, and trees. In general, maneuver decision making acts based on the perception results. To predict potential risks for the traffic, the extracted features via perception algorithms are fused by various schemes, \eg Bayesian networks~ _cite_ and fuzzy-related uncertainty representation~ _cite_ . In~ _cite_, the most relevant features have been investigated with respect to the lane-change intentions in highway scenario. On the other hand, general driver models for lane-change maneuver have been presented, \eg Foresighted Driver Model (FDM) ~ _cite_ and Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes (MOBIL) ~ _cite_ . Although the above mentioned approaches allow a safe lane-change, complex procedures are required to interpret the situation with respect to lane-change decision. Our work is inspired by recent successes that use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to control autonomous vehicles with end-to-end learning fashion~ _cite_ . In~ _cite_, the authors trained a DCNN that directly maps an input image into a steer angle value. Chen~ \etal _cite_ ~ aimed to obtain structured outputs of the driving-relevant objects from an image input rather than directly controlling a car. Our approach lies somewhere between the two algorithms, since our model produces a single output that is used as an aid to the final decision making process. In this work, we expect that a DCNN can learn valid image features so that it classifies the occupancy status of the lanes. Eventually, the proposed framework helps human drivers and autonomous vehicles avoid lane-change crashes. In this paper, we aim to develop an end-to-end learning framework that assists safe lane-change decision. Instead of object detection or tracking approaches, we formulate an image classification problem that determines the status of adjacent lanes: \B~or \F~ (see Fig.~ _ref_) . Two cameras with a wide angle lens are installed at the exterior of our research vehicle to acquire rear side view images. To train and test Safe Lane-Change decision Aid Network (SLCAN), we collected and annotated N, N images. For an efficient SLCAN training, we annotate the images according to whether the ego-vehicle can move on the corresponding space. The experimental results on driving videos show that SLCAN classifies occupancy status of the lanes with an accuracy over N \%. The main contributions of the paper are The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section~ _ref_, we propose an end-to-end learning framework for safe lane-change decision aid. Section~ _ref_ provides extensive experimental results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section~ _ref_ .
