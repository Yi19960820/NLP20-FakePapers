Liver lesion segmentation is an important step for liver cancer diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment evaluation. LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge) provides a common testbed for comparing different automatic liver lesion segmentation methods. We participate in this challenge by developing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) method. The particular DCNN model works in N in that it takes a stack of adjacent slices as input and produces the segmentation map corresponding to the center slice. The model has N layers in total and makes use of both long range concatenation connections of U-Net~ _cite_ and short-range residual connections from ResNet~ _cite_ . The model was trained using the N LiTS training datasets and achieved an average Dice score of N when evaluated on the N test CT scans, which ranked first for the LiTS challenge at the time of the ISBI N conference.
