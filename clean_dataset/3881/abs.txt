Accurately segmenting left atrium in MR volume can benefit the ablation procedure of atrial fibrillation. Traditional automated solutions often fail in relieving experts from the labor-intensive manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based solution for automated left atrium segmentation in gadolinium-enhanced MR volumes with promising performance. We firstly argue that, for this volumetric segmentation task, networks in ND fashion can present great superiorities in time efficiency and segmentation accuracy than networks with ND fashion. Considering the highly varying shape of atrium and the branchy structure of associated pulmonary veins, we propose to adopt a pyramid module to collect semantic cues in feature maps from multiple scales for fine-grained segmentation. Also, to promote our network in classifying the hard examples, we propose an Online Hard Negative Example Mining strategy to identify voxels in slices with low classification certainties and penalize the wrong predictions on them. Finally, we devise a competitive training scheme to further boost the generalization ability of networks. Extensively verified on N testing volumes, our proposed framework achieves an average Dice of _inline_eq_ in segmenting the left atria and pulmonary veins.
