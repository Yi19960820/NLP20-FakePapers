The paper explores the topic of Facial Action Unit (FAU) detection in the wild. In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions: (N) how useful are residual connections across dense blocks for face analysis? (N) how useful is the information from a network trained for categorical Facial Expression Recognition (FER) for the task of FAU detection? The proposed network (ResiDen) exploits dense blocks along with residual connections and uses auxiliary information from a FER network. The experiments are performed on the EmotionNet and DISFA datasets. The experiments show the usefulness of facial expression information for AU detection. The proposed network achieves state-of-art results on the two databases. Analysis of the results for cross database protocol shows the effectiveness of the network.
