Facial expressions play a significant role in human communication and behavior. Psychologists have long studied the relationship between facial expressions and emotions. Paul Ekman \etal _cite_, devised the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to taxonomize human facial expressions and model their behavior. The ability to recognize facial expressions automatically, enables novel applications in fields like human-computer interaction, social gaming, and psychological research. There has been a tremendously active research in this field, with several recent papers utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and inference. In this paper, we employ CNN understanding methods to study the relation between the features these computational networks are using, the FACS and Action Units (AU) . We verify our findings on the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK +), NovaEmotions and FERN datasets. We apply these models to various tasks and tests using transfer learning, including cross-dataset validation and cross-task performance. Finally, we exploit the nature of the FER based CNN models for the detection of micro-expressions and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy using a simple long-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) .
