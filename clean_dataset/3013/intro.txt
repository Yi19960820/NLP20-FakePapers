Myocardial Infarction (MI), commonly known as `heart attack', is the death of heart muscles due to prolonged lack of oxygen supply (ischemia) . Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in the United States and in most industrialized nations throughout the world. In N, on average, someone in USA died every N minutes due to a stroke _cite_ . Survival rates improve after a heart attack if treatment begins within N hour. This signifies the necessity of accurate and timely diagnosis of MI. A myocardial infarction is clinically defined as _cite_: Additionally, one of the following criteria have to be met: Although detection of elevated serum cardiac enzymes is more important than ECG changes, the cardiac enzymes can only be detected in the serum N-N hours after the onset of the myocardial infarction. Therefore, in the first few hours after the myocardial infarction, the ECG can be crucial. MI can be diagnosed by cardiologists based on the changes in the ECG, but the sensitivity and specificity of manual detection of acute MI is N \% and N \% as reported in _cite_ . Developing a computer aided system to automatically detect MI would help the cardiologists make better decisions. Hence, various researches has been conducted on MI detection. These researches has focused on wavelet transform-based methods _cite_ time-domain-based algorithm _cite_, ST-segment-based technique _cite_, hidden Markov model-based technique _cite_ and Vectorcardiogram based method _cite_ . These works have taken a hand-crafted feature extraction approach for the classification problem. It would be convenient if the process of feature extraction/selection could also be automated. With this intention in mind, researchers have tried to borrow elements from deep learning and apply them to ECG signals. The key advantage of deep learning is that the model itself learns the most discriminative features from raw data and tries to match its output with the desired result. Deep learning algorithms, at its inception, were mainly applied in computer vision _cite_ . In recent years, its application has quickly spread to many sectors including ECG signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been utilized in arrhythmia detection, coronary artery disease detection, beats classification _cite_ . Deep belief network has been used to classify signal quality in ECG _cite_ . Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have also been used in beats classification, obstruction of sleep apnea detection, ecg-based biometrics _cite_ In _cite_ researchers have implemented an N layer CNN to detect MI. Although the model achieved satisfactory results, it has been shown that deep learners are not necessary in ECG signal analysis _cite_ . By downsampling the ECG signal, the researchers were able to train a shallow CNN and achieve superior results in beat classification. Hence, there is scope of improvement regarding the reduction of network size and training complexity. Additionally, the experiment in _cite_ was based on a class-oriented approach, i.e., heartbeats extracted from ECG signals were randomly sampled to form test and train set. As a result samples from the same patient contained both in test and train. Therefore, it is not clear how the model will perform on patients it has never seen before. Hence, to test the model's generalization capability a subject-oriented approach _cite_ should be taken. In this approach, the heartbeats are grouped according to the patients. The model is tested on heartbeats from one patient while it is trained on heartbeats from rest of the patients. This procedure is repeated for the remaining the subjects. Myocardial infarction can be classified according to the location of the infarct. This paper focuses on the detection of inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) . We implement a shallow but wide CNN whose architecture resembles the inception module in GoogleNet _cite_ . A subject-oriented approach is taken to evaluate the model's performance on the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset _cite_ collected from PhysioNet _cite_ . It's performance is compared with the current state of the art _cite_ where IMI detection is done using features extracted from the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) of the ECG signal. We also compare the measure of class separability of the two methods in terms of geometric separability index and euclidean distance. The paper is organized in the following way: In section _ref_ the proposed method is described, in section _ref_ the experimental results are discussed, in section _ref_ quality of feature is compared between the proposed and benchmark model and the conclusion is drawn in section _ref_ .
