Super Resolution (SR) problem is defined as recovering a high resolution image from a low resolution image. This is a highly ill-posed problem with multiple solutions possible for a single input image. This problem finds many applications such as medical imaging, security and surveillance among others. In recent years, deep learning methods have performed better as compared to interpolation-based _cite_, reconstruction-based _cite_ or other example-based methods _cite_ that have been used in the past. This is proved by the fact that the first effort in the direction of deep learning for solving the problem of single image super resolution _cite_ performed better than several previous models not using deep learning algorithms. This lead to development of several other methods that used deep learning _cite_ . However, all these methods in order to get a slight performance improvement (in terms of PSNR) promoted use of deep, computationally heavy CNN models. It would be objectively correct to say that such heavy resources are not available at all situations for such lengthy periods of time. In order to solve this problem, it is required to build a model that uses less number of multiplication-addition operations (FLOPs) to come up with a high resolution image. In this work, we present a novel super resolution model termed SRCondeseNet that uses the concept of removing unused connections in the network to form group convolutions. Normal group convolutions also help in reducing the number of connections but the latter method comes with a huge loss in accuracy. Once the features are extracted using this reduced model, reconstruction is done using deconvolutional layers with NxN kernels to produce a high resolution image. Also applied is the concept of residual learning i.e. the bicubic upsampled input is added to network output so that the model only has to learn the difference _cite_ .
