Unlike a conventional background inpainting approach that infers a missing area from image patches similar to the background, face completion requires semantic knowledge about the target object for realistic outputs. Current image inpainting approaches utilize generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve such semantic understanding. However, in adversarial learning, the semantic knowledge is learned implicitly and hence good semantic understanding is not always guaranteed. In this work, we propose a collaborative adversarial learning approach to face completion to explicitly induce the training process. Our method is formulated under a novel generative framework called collaborative GAN (collaGAN), which allows better semantic understanding of a target object through collaborative learning of multiple tasks including face completion, landmark detection and semantic segmentation. Together with the collaGAN, we also introduce an inpainting concentrated scheme such that the model emphasizes more on inpainting instead of autoencoding. Extensive experiments show that the proposed designs are indeed effective and collaborative adversarial learning provides better feature representations of the faces. In comparison with other generative image inpainting models and single task learning methods, our solution produces superior performances on all tasks.
