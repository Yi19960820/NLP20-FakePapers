The work in this paper is driven by the question if spatio-temporal correlations are enough for ND convolutional neural networks (CNN) ? Most of the traditional ND networks use local spatio-temporal features. We introduce a new block that models correlations between channels of a ND CNN with respect to temporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit to different parts of ND CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation' (STC) . By embedding this block to the current state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNext and ResNet, we improved the performance by N-N \% on Kinetics dataset. Our experiments show that adding STC blocks to current state-of-the-art architectures outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the HMDBN, UCFN and Kinetics datasets. The other issue in training ND CNNs is about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in ND CNNs is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained ND CNN to a randomly initialized ND CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for ND CNNs. Thus, by fine-tuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in ND CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-NM, and fine-tuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDBN/UCFN. \iffalse The STC codes will be released soon. \fi
