We propose a new deep learning approach for automatic detection and segmentation of fluid within retinal OCT images. The proposed framework utilizes both {\it ResNet} and {\it Encoder-Decoder} neural network architectures. When training the network, we apply a novel data augmentation method called {\it myopic warping} together with standard rotation-based augmentation to increase the training set size to _inline_eq_ times the original amount. Finally, the network output is post-processed with an energy minimization algorithm (graph cut) along with a few other knowledge guided morphological operations to finalize the segmentation process. Based on OCT imaging data and its ground truth from the RETOUCH challenge, the proposed system achieves dice indices of _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_, and _inline_eq_, and average absolute volume differences of _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_, and _inline_eq_ mm _inline_eq_ for intaretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, and pigment epithelial detachment respectively.
