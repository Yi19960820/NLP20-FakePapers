Decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin _cite_, enabled a wide spectrum of novel applications. Based on the Blockchain, the underlying distributed core of Bitcoin, applications ranging from smart contracts, verifiable data, and transactions, audit systems, among others, made a significant impact on the way that we can make transactions and build systems with trust minimization or no third-party involved at all. Supported and advocated by a vibrant community, Blockchain is a technology that can be applied to many contexts beyond cryptocurrency and financial assets _cite_ . In the recent years, we also saw the fast development of Deep Learning _cite_, especially in the Computer Vision area, where we were able to see major milestones such as the well known AlexNet _cite_, VGGNet _cite_ GoogleNet _cite_ and more recently the ResNets _cite_ . The representation of high-dimensional data, such as natural images, by low-dimensional embeddings learned using deep neural networks with multiple hierarchical features, allowed not only image classification, but also many different applications such as visual search _cite_ _cite_, image hashing _cite_ _cite_ _cite_, image captioning _cite_ and many other applications. Although the synergy between the Blockchain or Blockchain-based technology and Machine Learning/AI was mentioned in the health context, such as in _cite_ for the application of secure large-scale data management mechanism to coordinate the information of individuals, and more recently in _cite_ for the application of a verifiable data audit system, there are very few published works or implemented applications exploring this integration between learned representations and the Blockchain beyond the trend of Machine Learning model auditing. In _cite_, the author also speculatively cites an application of the Blockchain and AI systems, but for the context of communication between AI entities in order to conduct certain transactions. In this context, our work focuses on the exploration of this potential synergy between representation learning and the Blockchain by means of novel practical application example and experimentation. Our contributions are as follows: first, we focus on the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) _cite_ and metric learning _cite_ to produce embeddings for the purpose of cryptography key-pair derivation. Later, we develop a method for deriving Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key-pairs from deep embeddings extracted from natural images, as well as an application example using the Blockchain technology that will allow us to create transactions that can only be redeemed by individuals owning the same similar images or the transaction owner. The ECDSA is used by the Bitcoin to promote cryptography guarantees for the transactions, ensuring that funds can only be spent by their owners, thus we use the same mechanisms in this work to promote cryptographic guarantees for the fund transactions. Later, we discuss future extensions of this work and other potential applications of this integration between representation learning and cryptocurrencies/Blockchain.
