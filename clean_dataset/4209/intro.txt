measurements are blurred and distorted by the Instrument response function (IRF) also called Point Spread Function (PSF) in imaging and Impulse Response in the time domain. This distortion can arise from physical limitations such as limited bandwidth of the instrument (time response or diffraction in the case of spatial measurements), from instrument aberrations, blurring from moving samples, aliasing from discrete sampling (pixel size, sampling interval) and noise. In many cases the relation between the target information _inline_eq_ and the measured data _inline_eq_ are given by a convolution with the IRF (_inline_eq_) i.e: Here _inline_eq_ is assumed to be contained in a ball in _inline_eq_ and the measurement _inline_eq_ samples a region contained in that ball. The function _inline_eq_ is obtained after pixelation the original IRF _inline_eq_, that is; _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ is the characteristic function of the cube _inline_eq_ . The function _inline_eq_ for any practical purpose can be assumed to have compact support and the measurement _inline_eq_ will sample a ball larger than the resulting support off _inline_eq_ . Also _inline_eq_ is only sampled for certain values _inline_eq_, which are the pixels, being each _inline_eq_ a vector in _inline_eq_, _inline_eq_ the number of pixels with _inline_eq_ . Finally _inline_eq_ is a random variable that averages to zero representing the noise and _inline_eq_ is the background (its noise is included in _inline_eq_) . Very efficient strategies have been developed to overcome the limitations from the undersampling (aliasing) such as resolution enhancement (also called super-resolution or high resolution image reconstruction, _cite_) . The technique relies in overcoming the aliasing arising from the undersampling by taking multiple displaced records (or images) of the data (assumed invariant) . This scheme obviously requires multiple images for the reconstruction. Many deblurring algorithms have been developed to restore images distorted by moving targets or out of focus acquisitions _cite_ but the main point in this cases is that the camera is not loosing high spatial frequency components, the image is simply distorted (blurred) due to phase distortions. Hence this type of reconstructions do not correspond strictly to super-resolution techniques (recovery of attenuated high frequency components) . A fantastic solution known as compressed sensing has been found for sparse data showing that for certain set of undersampled functions an exact recovery is possible (see _cite_ and _cite_) . This idea of compressed sensing was used recently also in _cite_ to recover _inline_eq_ from _inline_eq_, when _inline_eq_ is given by a theoretical and particular function and _inline_eq_ . The sparcity prior is a very restrictive constraint as in _cite_ it was shown that the quality of the reconstruction is severely hurt when three or more sources are overlapping within the IRF. Recent works have extended the technique to sparse signal restoration on a continuous grid (see _cite_ _cite_ _cite_) . But the reconstruction of continuous distribution or high density of sources has not been possible. The conceptual limit to sparsity is having a single point source (a molecule for an image, a spectral line, an extremely short pulse, etc.) and finding its location by solving a least square problem from . This localization scheme has been successfully used for particle tracking in microscopy (see _cite_) and more recently for super-resolution imaging by STORM or PALM (see _cite_) . The techniques rely in successively locate fluorescent molecules one at a time until the total image is reconstructed. As the localization method requires that two molecules are not simultaneously ignited with overlapping IRF, this requires the acquisition of thousands or even tens of thousands of images for a single reconstruction. Using compressed sensing schemes STORM (see (_cite_) or locating simultaneously several sources (see _cite_) image acquisition has been speeded by localizing simultaneously several molecules within the point spread function. Still we are dealing with extremely sparse individual images requiring hundreds or thousands of images to complete the restoration. The super-resolution recovery from inversion of the convolution equation presented in from a single frame still remains a challenge. Several strategies have been followed with the simplification of assuming that the instrument response function has translational invariance. For this case the inversion of the problem given in can be done by trivial Fourier analysis in the absence of noise, but that requires special care because the noise is amplified in such simple minded processing. One example of the limitation given by is the deconvolution of microscopic images obtained from fluorescent samples (typical in biology) . In this cases N dimensional image reconstruction from stacks of images at different planes or confocal scans where performed following different strategies. The simplest case is truncated inverse filtering, that is, deconvolving in the Fourier transform space by dividing by the Fourier transformation of the PSF truncated to avoid the noise amplification at high frequencies (see _cite_) or Wigner filtering (see _cite_ and _cite_) . None of these techniques can recover the high frequency components of the image, and hence do not provide a super-resolution restoration. A way to deal with the noise has been to convert the deconvolution problem in a linear least square fit problem by searching for the target function _inline_eq_ that convolved with the instrument response function minimizes the distance to the measured data _inline_eq_ (see _cite_) but these methods do not recover the high frequency components remaining limited by the instrument function response cut-off. In addition negative values for _inline_eq_ frequently are obtained and they are very sensitive to the quality of the measurement of the IRF. The key to overcome the IRF limit is to incorporate additional information to the process. One first approach is to force _inline_eq_ and performing a nonlinear least square fit (see _cite_), at the expense of a high computational cost. An alternative is to clip the negative values in an iterative algorithm as done in the Tikhonov-Miller algorithm (see _cite_, _cite_ and _cite_) . More robust deconvolution schemes have been obtained adding wavelet denoising methods (see _cite_) but only marginal increase in the resolution is obtained. One key aspect of any deconvolution technique is the quality of the IRF used. Examples of the effort to measure the IRF are _cite_ for spectrometers, for x-ray diffractometers (see _cite_ _cite_), and _cite_ for image PSF for Astronomy where the compressed sensing schemes are incorporated. For fluorescence microscopy an alternative approach has been to compute theoretically the PSF for an objective based on the manufacturer objective parameters (see _cite_) . But the actual IRF will not be in general shift invariant, will have aberrations not accounted by theoretical predictions and must be accurately measured for high resolution deconvolution methods. A common experimental scenario as encountered when the detectors measure intensity (light, X-ray, particles, etc.) is that _inline_eq_ is positive. For such cases in this work we present a new algorithm for data deconvolution that allows the retrieval of the target function _inline_eq_ with super-resolution with a simple approach of assuming that the source distribution can be approximated by a superposition of virtual point sources of equal intensities. The function _inline_eq_ can be either a continuous distribution or a discrete superposition of sources of arbitrary intensities. These virtual sources reconstruct the actual distribution by locating them in such a manner that the cloud of sources reproduces with enough precision the actual distribution. In this manner only the positions of the sources need to be determined by an algorithm, that minimizes the norm of the difference between the measured data and the convolution of the superposed point sources with the IRF. The problem of finding the intensity of each position is converted to finding the position of the point sources. The intensity fit is achieved by accumulating many sources in close proximity. The positions have no constraint, and the reconstruction is made from a single acquisition or image. The sparsity prior is not required although it will be shown that the method has a better resolution for sparser sources. In the next section the fundamentals of the method are presented, followed by the estimation of the uncertainties of the reconstruction and a determination of the number of sources needed for maximal resolution and finally an artificially synthesized fluorescent image and two experimental examples are presented, one is an optical spectra (one dimensional problem with subtracted background) and the other one is fluorescent microscope images (two dimensional example with unknown background) . For the fluorescent images the simulated data allow the comparison of the retrieved solution with the ground truth, verifying the predicted resolution.
