We present a method to address the challenging problem of segmentation of lumbar vertebrae from CT images acquired with varying fields of view. Our method is based on cascaded ND Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) consisting of a localization FCN and a segmentation FCN. More specifically, in the first step we train a regression ND FCN (we call it ``LocalizationNet") to find the bounding box of the lumbar region. After that, a ND U-net like FCN (we call it ``SegmentationNet") is then developed, which after training, can perform a pixel-wise multi-class segmentation to map a cropped lumber region volumetric data to its volume-wise labels. Evaluated on publicly available datasets, our method achieved an average Dice coefficient of N _inline_eq_ N \% and an average symmetric surface distance of N _inline_eq_ N mm.
