Zero-shot learning aims to recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training~ _cite_ . The number of new zero-shot learning methods proposed every year has been increasing rapidly, i.e. the good aspects as our title suggests. Although each new method has been shown to make progress over the previous one, it is difficult to quantify this progress without an established evaluation protocol, i.e. the bad aspects. In fact, the quest for improving numbers has lead to even flawed evaluation protocols, i.e. the ugly aspects. Therefore, in this work, we propose to extensively evaluate a significant number of recent zero-shot learning methods in depth on several small to large-scale datasets using the same evaluation protocol both in zero-shot, i.e. training and test classes are disjoint, and the more realistic generalized zero-shot learning settings, i.e. training classes are present at test time. We benchmark and systematically evaluate zero-shot learning w.r.t. three aspects, i.e. methods, datasets and evaluation protocol. The crux of the matter for all zero-shot learning methods is to associate observed and non observed classes through some form of auxiliary information which encodes visually distinguishing properties of objects. Different flavors of zero-shot learning methods that we evaluate in this work are linear~ _cite_ and nonlinear~ _cite_ compatibility learning frameworks whereas an orthogonal direction is learning independent attribute~ _cite_ classifiers and finally others~ _cite_ propose a hybrid model between independent classifier learning and compatibility learning frameworks. We thoroughly evaluate the second aspect of zero-shot learning, by using multiple splits of several small to large-scale datasets~ _cite_ . We emphasize that it is hard to obtain labeled training data for fine-grained classes of rare objects recognizing which requires expert opinion. Therefore, we argue that zero-shot learning methods should be evaluated mainly on least populated or rare classes. We propose a unified evaluation protocol to address the third aspect of zero-shot learning which is arguably the most important one. We emphasize the necessity of tuning hyperparameters of the methods on a validation class split that is disjoint from training classes as improving zero-shot learning performance via tuning parameters on test classes violates the zero-shot assumption. We argue that per-class averaged top-N accuracy is an important evaluation metric when the dataset is not well balanced with respect to the number of images per class. We point out that extracting image features via a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) on a large dataset that contains zero-shot test classes also violates the zero-shot learning idea as image feature extraction is a part of the training procedure. Moreover, we argue that demonstrating zero-shot performance on small-scale and coarse grained datasets, i.e. aPY~ _cite_ is not conclusive. We recommend to abstract away from the restricted nature of zero-shot evaluation and make the task more practical by including training classes in the search space, i.e. generalized zero-shot learning setting. Therefore, we argue that our work plays an important role in advancing the zero-shot learning field by analyzing the good and bad aspects of the zero-shot learning task as well as proposing ways to eliminate the ugly ones.
