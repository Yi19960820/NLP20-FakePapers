In N, breast cancer caused N, N deaths worldwide along with N million new cases~ _cite_ . Early diagnosis of the disease and proper treatment is essential to improve the survival rates. Examination of breast tissue biopsy using hematoxylin and eosin (H \&E) stain plays a crucial role in determining the type of lesion for primary diagnosis. Hematoxylin stains the nuclei purple and eosin stains the cytoplasm pinkish. This staining helps the pathologist identify the grade of carcinoma, which in turn determines the type of treatment to be provided to the patient. In this work we designed a deep learning based method to classify breast cancer slides. This work is part of our entry in the BACH challenge~ _cite_ . Solutions to this problem can potentially be used to reduce diagnoses errors, increase the throughput of pathologists, or be used in second opinion or teaching tools. Tumors are believed to progress in phases. Normal breast tissues have large regions of cytoplasm (pinkish regions) with a dense cluster of nuclei forming glands in H \&E stained slides (Fig. N-A) . Benign lesion consists of multiple adjacent clusters of small-sized nuclei (Fig. N-B) . Unchecked benign lesions can progress to in situ carcinoma in which the size of nuclei in the clusters increases and nucleoli within the nucleus become prominent, but the tumor seems to be circumscribed in round clusters while losing some of their glandular appearance (Fig. N-C) . In invasive carcinoma the enlarged nuclei break their clustered structure and spread to the nearby regions in fragments (Fig. N-D) . Carcinoma images have a high nuclear density with an absence of structure in inter-nuclear arrangement as compared to in situ carcinoma images, which still have a preserved inter-nuclear structure. The recent success of CNNs for natural image classification has inspired others and us to use them on medical images, e.g. for histopathology image classification. Spanhol et al .~ _cite_ used an ImageNet~ _cite_ based CNN architecture for classifying benign and malignant tumors. They extracted patches of sizes N _inline_eq_ N and N _inline_eq_ N from the images to train their CNN. In their results they showed that the accuracy of their CNN decreases with increase in magnification. Ciresan et al .~ _cite_, who won the ICPR N mitosis detection contest, trained a CNN on N _inline_eq_ N size patches extracted from images. This enabled them to analyze nuclei of different sizes. Cruz-Roa et al .~ _cite_ trained a CNN on N _inline_eq_ N size patches extracted out of whole slide images. They addressed the problem of detecting invasive carcinoma regions in whole slide images. Their CNN was able to extract structural as well as nucleus-based features. Their method established the-state-of-the-art by achieving an FN-score of N A recently proposed method by Ara jo et al ~ _cite_ addressed the problem of classifying H \&E stained images as normal, benign, in situ, or invasive carcinoma. In their approach they normalized the images using the method proposed in~ _cite_ . They extracted N _inline_eq_ N patches from the normalized images to train their proposed CNN architecture. They also trained a CNN + SVM classifier for patch classification. Dataset augmentation was also performed by mirroring and rotating the patches. Images were classified by combining the patch probabilities using i) majority voting, ii) maximum probability and iii) sum of probabilities. Challenges in the BACH dataset include vast areas in images without any epithelium (where the cancer starts) and areas of seemingly intermediate visual patterns between two neighboring classes.
