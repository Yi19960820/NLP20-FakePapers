In this short note we introduce ResearchDoom, an implementation of the Doom first-person shooter that can extract detailed metadata from the game. We also introduce the CocoDoom dataset, a collection of pre-recorded data extracted from Doom gaming sessions along with annotations in the MS Coco format. ResearchDoom and CocoDoom can be used to train and evaluate a variety of computer vision methods such as object recognition, detection and segmentation at the level of instances and categories, tracking, ego-motion estimation, monocular depth estimation and scene segmentation. The code and data are available at _url_ .
