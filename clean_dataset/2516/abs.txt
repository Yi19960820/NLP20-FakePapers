Relative location prediction in computed tomography (CT) scan images is a challenging problem. In this paper, a regression model based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks is proposed to determine the relative location of a CT scan image both robustly and precisely. A public dataset is employed to validate the performance of the studyâ€™s proposed method using a N-fold cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate an excellent performance of the proposed model when compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a median absolute error of N cm and mean absolute error of N cm.
