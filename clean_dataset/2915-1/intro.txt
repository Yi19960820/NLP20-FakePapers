Autoregressive models are a powerful class of generative models that factorize the joint probability of a data sample _inline_eq_ into a product of conditional probabilities. Autoregressive models such as Wavenet, ByteNet, PixelCNN, and Video Pixel Networks have shown strong performance in audio, textual, image, and video generation. Unfortunately, generating in a na ve fashion is typically too slow for practical use. For example, generating a batch of _inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ images using PixelCNN + + takes more then N minutes on commodity hardware with a Tesla~KN GPU. The ability to do fast generation is useful for many applications. Production environments have tight latency constraints, so real-time speech generation, machine translation, and image super-resolution all require fast generation. Furthermore, quick simulation of environment dynamics is important for fast training in model-based reinforcement learning . However, slow generation hampers the use of convolutional autoregressive models in these situations. In this work, we present a method to significantly speed up generation in convolutional autoregressive models. The contributions of this work are as follows:
