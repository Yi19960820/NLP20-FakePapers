The ability to automatically and reliably identify tree species from images of bark is an important problem, but has received limited attention in the vision and robotics communities. Early work in mobile robotics has already shown that the ability to recognize trees from non-trees in combined LiDAR + camera sensing can improve localization robustness~ _cite_ . More recent work on data-efficient semantic localization and mapping algorithms~ _cite_ have demonstrated the value of semantically-meaningful landmarks; In our situation, trees and the knowledge of their species would act as such semantic landmarks. The robotics community is also increasingly interested in flying drones in forests~ _cite_ . In terms of forestry applications, one could use this visual species identification to perform autonomous forest inventory. In the context of autonomous tree harvesting operations~ _cite_, the harvester or forwarder would be able to sort timber by species, improving the operator's margins. Similarly, sawmill processes such as debarking could be fine-tuned or optimized based on the species knowledge of the currently processed log. For tree species identification, relying on bark has many advantages when compared to other attributes, such as the appearance of its leaves or fruits. First of all, bark is always present despite seasonal changes. It is also present on logs long after the trees have been cut and stored in a lumber yard. In the case of standing tree inventory, bark tends to be visually accessible to most robots, as foliage is not prevalent at the robot's height in forests of commercial value. However, tree species classification using only images of the bark is a challenging task that even trained humans struggle to do, as some species have only very subtle differences in their bark structure. For example, two human experts obtained respectively N \% and N \% classification accuracy on the~ Austrian Federal Forests (AFF) dataset~ _cite_ . Recent progress in deep learning have shown that neural networks are able to surpass human performance on many visual recognition tasks~ _cite_ . One significant drawback of deep learning approaches is that they generally require very large datasets to obtain satisfactory results. For instance, the ImageNet database contains N millions images separated in almost N, N synsets. In the literature, there is no equivalent database for bark recognition, in terms of size or variety. For example, the largest one is the AFF dataset~ _cite_, with only around N, N images covering N species. This dataset is also private, making it difficult to use in an open, scientific context. This lack of data might explain why the majority of research on bark recognition has been mostly centered around hand-crafted features such as Gabor filters~ _cite_, SIFT~ _cite_ or Local Binary Pattern~ _cite_, as they can be trained using smaller datasets. To address this issue, we gathered a novel bark dataset specifically designed to train deep neural networks. It contains N, N high-resolution images of N different tree species found in forests and parks near Quebec City, Canada, from which over N, N unique crops of NxN pixels can be extracted. The species are typical trees present on the eastern seaboard forests of Canada, most of which have commercial value. In addition to providing the species annotation, we also collected the tree diameter at breast height (DBH), a commonly-used metric in forest inventories. The DBH captures in some sense the age of the tree, thus having the possibility to provide auxiliary information to the network during training. Indeed, bark appearance can change drastically with age, which might help a network optimizer in finding solutions that exhibit better generalization performance. Moreover, having this extra label opens up the possibility to experiment with multi-task learning approaches, for which few datasets exists in the literature~ _cite_ . The contributions presented in this paper are as follow: This paper is organized as follows. In Section~ _ref_, we review existing methods and datasets used to accomplish bark image classification. Section~ _ref_ introduces our dataset, and details on how it was collected. Section~ _ref_ describes the network architecture used to perform classification. Section~ _ref_ presents the results obtained for various test cases. Finally, Section~ _ref_ concludes this paper.
