Deep learning is in a stage of infancy but promises to allow for the full utilization of large datasets in order to solve machine learning problems. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have far surpassed traditional classification and regression techniques, and have even surpassed human performance on a number of well-known benchmarks _cite_ _cite_ . Good results have been obtained using combinations of classifiers, regressors, hand-crafted features, facial landmarks, and dimensionality reduction _cite_ _cite_ _cite_ . Neural networks, however, have taken the scene with their ability to learn and memorize features, and keep improving in accuracy as more data are observed. This paper studies the use of transfer learning to tackle the problem of recognizing a person's age and gender from an image using deep convolutional neural networks. A variety of network designs and training techniques are explored.
