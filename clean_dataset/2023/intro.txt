In this paper we are primarily interested in (N) detecting the line of reflection (mirror) symmetry in ND and, (N) given such a line, finding the straight that divides the symmetric object into its mirror symmetric parts (Figure~ _ref_ ~ (a, b)) . As a byproduct, we develop a coefficient (likelihood) of reflection symmetry, that can be used to locate near circular shapes (Figure~ _ref_ ~ (e)) . Symmetry detection algorithms can be classified as: feature-centered, or parameter-centered. Feature-centered; where image features (whatever they might be) are computed first, and the symmetry parameters are computed from them. Parameter-centered; where we start from the parameters, and then look for image features that support them. To the best of our knowledge, all previous works fall in the first category. The approach presented here falls in the second. Our symmetry likelihood model is based on products of complex-valued wavelet convolutions. This parameter-centered approach has advantages when the object sizes are known a priori, as demonstrated in an ellipse detection application. In addition, we release a new database for ND symmetry detection, with N + times as many single symmetry images, and N + times as many multiple symmetry images as the most recently published database _cite_ . We compare our model against the state of the art in _cite_, outperforming it on the single-symmetry case. Code: Database: Note: This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters.
