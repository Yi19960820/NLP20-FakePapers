the last decade or so, interest in deep learning has skyrocketed. Deep learning had been around for many years but got little interest from researchers; may be due to low computing powers and network speeds or may be huge unstructured data were not commonplace? Now everybody is talking about it and want to contribute in the form of tutorials, special courses, articles, blogs, source codes, APIs and original research. And that has helped a lot in developing a general understanding about the underlying concepts. One can't recall any other issue got that much help available in such a short span of time, be it iPython notebooks on GitHub, Matlab implementations (MatConvNet~ _cite_), C + + API in the form of Caffe~ _cite_ or R-language based source codes or even patents.~ _cite_ . If you are interested, there's no dearth of resources and they will make sure you learn it. As far as super-resolution is concerned, the pioneering work on the role of deep learning is as fresh as N~ _cite_ . Since then, there has been a mushroom growth and several works have appeared focusing not only images but also videos and higher dimensional multimedia data, especially depth maps or range images, digital elevation models (DEMs) and multispectral images. The cornerstone of all the relevant research is the single image super-resolution method~ _cite_, called Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), which is an extension of the pioneering work~ _cite_ called SRCNN-Ex by its authors. The importance of SRCNN can be gauged by the fact that since its appearance, you will hardly find a super-resolution work not using it as one of its benchmarks. In this paper we attempt to survey the deep learning literature in the context multimedia super-resolution. The main focus is on three areas, still images, videos and higher dimensions, especially the range data. For each of the three, we first introduce the relevant benchmarks before reviewing the contemporary literature on deep learning based super-resolution, which is followed by a comparison of important methods on the basis of a common dataset. In case of higher dimensions, however, a common dataset is elusive. The description of benchmarks is in the form of publicly available datasets and important super-resolution methods that are not deep learning based; the latter will be introduced in the subsequent discussion, none the less. For benchmarking among methods, we rely on the results reported in the literature and have therefore compiled the tabular data from relevant resources. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section~ _ref_ presents essential background concepts with reference to deep learning and super-resolution. Section~ _ref_ surveys the contemporary deep learning works on image SR. A special part of this section concerns the importance of SRCNN with references from literature. The next two sections, i.e. Section~ _ref_ and Section~ _ref_, follow the same approach for videos and ND/depth maps, respectively. Section~ _ref_ concludes the paper.
