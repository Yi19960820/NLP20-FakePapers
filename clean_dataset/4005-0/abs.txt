Point source detection at low signal-to-noise is challenging for astronomical surveys, particularly in radio interferometry images where the noise is correlated. Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the development of algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We present \name-a deep learning solution-that uses convolutional neural networks to achieve these goals. \name enhances the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect sources. Trained and tested on two sets of _inline_eq_ simulated _inline_eq_ MeerKAT images with a total of _inline_eq_ sources, \name is essentially perfect in both purity and completeness down to SNR = _inline_eq_ and outperforms PyBDSF in all metrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a {\em Purity} _inline_eq_ {\em Completeness} (PC) score at SNR = _inline_eq_ of _inline_eq_, compared to _inline_eq_ for the best PyBDSF model. For natural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of _inline_eq_ in the PC score at SNR = _inline_eq_ . If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drop to _inline_eq_, we find that \name reaches this value at SNR = _inline_eq_ compared to the _inline_eq_ of PyBDSF (natural-weighting) . A key advantage of \name is that it can learn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under consideration. Our results show that deep learning is a promising approach to point source detection in astronomical images.
