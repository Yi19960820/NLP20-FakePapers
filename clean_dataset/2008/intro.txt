Face age progression~ _cite_, also called face aging, is to predict the future looks of a person. It is one of the key techniques for a variety of applications, including looking for the missing person, cross-age face analysis~ _cite_ and so on. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to generating realistic aged faces, which can be roughly divided into two categories: physical model-based age progression~ _cite_ and prototype-based age progression~ _cite_ . The physical model-based methods model the facial patterns and physical mechanisms of aging. While, the prototype-based age progression methods transfer the differences between prototypes (e.g., the average face of each group) into the individual faces. Deep learning methods have also been applied in face age progression due to their powerful feature representations. Wang et al.~ _cite_ showed a recurrent face aging framework and Zhang et al.~ _cite_ proposed conditional adversarial autoencoder framework (CAAE) for age progression. However, existing works always generate only one future look for a person, while totally ignore the future look of a person may change in different occupations. For example, a N-years-old young man chooses actor/farmer as his career. When he is N-years-old, the look of the farmer and the look of the actor may have some differences even for the same person. Different occupations may have different appearances~ _cite_ as shown in Figure~ _ref_ . In this paper, we explore the impact of occupations on the age progression. Note that, for different occupations, the most perceptible difference is skin texture. Hence, we only focus on skin aging~ in this work. We firstly introduce occupational face aging dataset (OFAD) . Figure~ _ref_ shows some example faces. OFAD is a comprehensively annotated dataset that contains five kinds of occupations: actor, singer, doctor, teacher and farmer. Each occupation includes two range of ages, i.e., N-N and N-N. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first face aging dataset with occupational information. We believe this dataset is benefit for the researches in face progression under different occupations. We further present a realistic image generation for aging progression under different occupations via the proposed occupational-aware adversarial face aging network which is referred as OAFA. Different from previous approaches which only have one output for one age group, our OAFA can generate several outputs of different occupations. OAFA has three major components: N) the generator/encoder aims to generate different future looks for a young face of different occupations, N) the decoder brings the future looks back to the young face, and N) the discriminator aims to encourage generator/encoder to generate high quality images of different occupations. The three major components make up two networks: personalized network and occupational-aware adversarial network. The personalized network is an autoencoder network which is formed by the generator/encoder and the decoder. We propose a personalized loss to make the original face can be regenerated by the future looks to keep personalized facial characteristics. The occupational-aware adversarial network consists of the generator/encoder and the discriminator components. The proposed occupational loss includes two terms: conditional adversarial loss~ _cite_ and triplet rank loss~ _cite_, which aims to obtain the visually plausible texture changes, i.e., skin aging, for different occupations. Our contributions can be summarized as following:
