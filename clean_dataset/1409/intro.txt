Visual tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which has many practical applications including video surveillance, vehicle navigation, to name a few. The tracking algorithms can be roughly divided into two branches: short-term tracking and long-term tracking. For the former one, the tracked object is almost always in the camera's field of view but not necessarily fully visible. The tracking algorithm focuses on estimating the accurate positions and scales of the target in short-term sequences. In recent years, numerous trackers~ _cite_ have achieved very promising results in short-term tracking benchmarks (such as OTB~ _cite_ and VOTN~ _cite_) . However, the experiments on these benchmarks cannot well evaluate the long-term tracking performance of different trackers, and cannot provide valid references for the realistic tracking systems. Recently, the importance of long-term tracking has been emphasized and some large-scale datasets have been well constructed to address this issue (such as VOTN LTBN~ _cite_ and OxUvA~ _cite_) . Besides common challenges in short-term scenarios, in the long-term tracking task, the tracked object requires to be captured in long-term sequences, and also disappears and reappears very frequently. Thus, this task provides more challenges than short-term tracking. Table~ _ref_ reports some statistics on the frame length and the number of absent labels in popular and recent short-term (OTB, VOTN) and long-term (VOTN LTBN and OxUvA) benchmarks. First, the frame length in long-term benchmarks is almost ten times longer than that in short-term benchmarks. In addition, there exist a large amount of labels in long-term tracking scenarios. Thus, it is vital for long-term trackers to provide a valid confidence score indicating the tracked object is or and have the capability of image-wide re-detection. Figure~ _ref_ provides visual results of our tracker in one representative sequence, which shows that our tracker can effectively identify the tracked object is or and estimate the accurate bounding box when it is . \par Up to now, few works have been done to deal with long-term challenges~ _cite_, The LCT~ _cite_ and PTAV~ _cite_ trackers just track and re-detect the target in a local search region, and cannot re-capture the target successfully after the target moves out of view and reappears again. The CMT~ _cite_ and FCLT~ _cite_ methods merely exploit a single matching or classification model for the entire tracking process, which makes the tracker easily drift due to online variations. The MUSTer algorithm~ _cite_ exploits ensemble models to treat short-term and long-term scenarios separately; however, its performance is not satisfactory mainly due to the adopted hand-crafted features. To deal with challenges in the long-term scenarios, we attempt to develop a deep-learning-based long-term tracker with an integration of regression and verification networks (Figure~ _ref_) . The regression network _inline_eq_ learns a generic matching function off-line to robustly handle the common appearance variations of the tracked object during the tracking process. The verification network _inline_eq_ further equips the tracker with a strong discriminative power by online learning. In each frame, _inline_eq_ regresses a series of candidate bounding boxes in a local search region, with their scores measuring the similarities between candidates and the object template. Then, _inline_eq_ learns a classification boundary online to further decide whether the most similar candidate is the true target or a distractor. The final confidence score is outputted by the integration of the scores from both _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_, and indicates the tracked object is or in the current frame. This score will be used to invoke the image-wide re-detection scheme if necessary. \par To summarize, the main contributions of this work are presented as follows: i) A novel long-term tracking framework is developed to combine an offline-learned regression network with an online-updated verification network. The regression model aims to candidate proposal, while the verification one is for target identification. ii) A novel object-specific regression network is proposed to generate a series of candidates being similar with the tracked object, which is offline learned effectively and handles intrinsic appearance variations robustly. iii) A valid confidence score is designed to determine the target is present or not, and to make the tracker dynamically switch between local search and global search. iv) Extensive evaluations on the VOTN LTBN and OxUvA long-term benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves the best performance in comparisons with other competing methods.
