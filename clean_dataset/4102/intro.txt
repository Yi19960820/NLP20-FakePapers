In order to safely and efficiently navigate through complex traffic comprised by human drivers, an autonomous vehicle needs to have the ability to take initiative, such as deciding when to change lanes, overtake another vehicle, or slowing down to allow other vehicles to merge. This requires the autonomous vehicle to have some ability to reason about the future motion of surrounding vehicles. This can be seen in existing tactical path planning algorithms _cite_, which depend on reliable estimation of future trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Prediction of future motion of surrounding vehicles is a challenging problem due to the high number of latent variables involved, such as, the end goals of all drivers in the scene and variability in driving style across different drivers. Vehicle trajectories tend to be highly non-linear over longer time horizons due to decisions made by the driver. Additionally, driver behavior tends to be inherently multi-modal, where a driver could make one of many decisions under the same traffic circumstances. Finally, interaction between vehicles tends to affect their motion. The large number of possible configurations of all vehicles in a scene can make this difficult to model. In spite of these challenges, there is structure to vehicle motion that can be exploited: Following the success of long-short term memory (LSTM) networks in modeling non-linear temporal dependencies in sequence learning and generation tasks _cite_, we propose an LSTM encoder-decoder based model for vehicle motion prediction for the case of freeway traffic. In particular, our model can be characterized by:
