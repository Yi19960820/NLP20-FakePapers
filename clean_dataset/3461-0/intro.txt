In recent years, scene text detection and recognition have attracted growing research interests from the computer vision community, especially after the revival of neural networks and growth of image datasets. Scene text detection and recognition provide an automatic, rapid approach to access the textual information embodied in natural scenes, benefiting a variety of real-world applications, such as geo-location~ _cite_, instant translation, and assistance for the blind. Scene text spotting, which aims at concurrently localizing and recognizing text from natural scenes, have been previously studied in numerous works~ _cite_ . However, in most works, except~ _cite_ and~ _cite_, text detection and subsequent recognition are handled separately. Text regions are first hunted from the original image by a trained detector and then fed into a recognition module. This procedure seems simple and natural, but might lead to sub-optimal performances for both detection and recognition, since these two tasks are highly correlated and complementary. On one hand, the quality of detections larges determines the accuracy of recognition; on the other hand, the results of recognition can provide feedback to help reject false positives in the phase of detection. Recently, two methods~ _cite_ that devise end-to-end trainable frameworks for scene text spotting have been proposed. Benefiting from the complementarity between detection and recognition, these unified models significantly outperform previous competitors. However, there are two major drawbacks in~ _cite_ and~ _cite_ . First, both of them can not be completely trained in an end-to-end manner. _cite_ applied a curriculum learning paradigm~ _cite_ in the training period, where the sub-network for text recognition is locked at the early iterations and the training data for each period is carefully selected. Busta~ ~ _cite_ at first pre-train the networks for detection and recognition separately and then jointly train them until convergence. There are mainly two reasons that stop ~ _cite_ and~ _cite_ from training the models in a smooth, end-to-end fashion. One is that the text recognition part requires accurate locations for training while the locations in the early iterations are usually inaccurate.The other is that the adopted LSTM~ _cite_ or CTC loss~ _cite_ are difficult to optimize than general CNNs. The second limitation of~ _cite_ and~ _cite_ lies in that these methods only focus on reading horizontal or oriented text. However, the shapes of text instances in real-world scenarios may vary significantly, from horizontal or oriented, to curved forms. In this paper, we propose a text spotter named as, which can detect and recognize text instances of arbitrary shapes. Here, arbitrary shapes mean various forms text instances in real world. Inspired by Mask R-CNN~ _cite_, which can generate shape masks of objects, we detect text by segment the instance text regions. Thus our detector is able to detect text of arbitrary shapes. Besides, different from the previous sequence-based recognition methods _cite_ which are designed for N-D sequence, we recognize text via semantic segmentation in N-D space, to solve the issues in reading irregular text instances. Another advantage is that it does not require accurate locations for recognition. Therefore, the detection task and recognition task can be completely trained end-to-end, and benefited from feature sharing and joint optimization. We validate the effectiveness of our model on the datasets that include horizontal, oriented and curved text. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in both text detection and end-to-end text recognition tasks. Specially, on ICDARN, evaluated at a single scale, our method achieves an F-Measure of N on the detection task and outperforms the previous top performers by _inline_eq_ on the end-to-end recognition task. The main contributions of this paper are four-fold. (N) We propose an end-to-end trainable model for text spotting, which enjoys a simple, smooth training scheme. (N) The proposed method can detect and recognize text of various shapes, including horizontal, oriented, and curved text.

(N) Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances in both text detection and text spotting on various benchmarks.
