Brain MRI is important for quantitative analysis of neurodevelopment at all ages. A particularly difficult age in the context of brain MRI analysis is the age of N months, where the contrast between white matter and gray matter is limited because of the development of myelination _cite_ . Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for infant brain MRI segmentation _cite_ . A specific type of CNNs proposed for image segmentation are dilated CNNs, which can achieve a large receptive field using a limited number of trainable weights _cite_ . In medical imaging, dilated CNNs have been used for cardiac MRI segmentation _cite_ . In this study, we investigate using a dilated triplanar CNN in combination with a non-dilated ND CNN for the segmentation of brain MRI of infants at an age of N months.
