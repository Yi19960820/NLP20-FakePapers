Image restoration is the process of estimating uncorrupted images from noisy or blurred ones. It is one of the most fundamental operation in image processing, video processing, and low-level computer vision. There exists a huge amount of literature addressing the topic of image restoration problems, see for example _cite_ for a survey. Broadly speaking, most state-of-the-art techniques mainly concentrate on achieving utmost image restoration quality, with little consideration on the computational efficiency _cite_ . However, there are two notable exceptions, BMND _cite_ and the recently proposed Cascade of Shrinkage Fields (CSF) _cite_ model, which simultaneously offer high efficiency and high image restoration quality. It is well-known that BMND is a highly engineered method, specialized for Gaussian noise. Moreover, it involves a block matching process, which is challenging for parallel computation on GPUs, alluding to the fact that it is not straightforward to accelerate BMND algorithm on parallel architectures. In contrast, the recently proposed CSF model offers high levels of parallelism, making it well suited for GPU implementation, thus owning high computational efficiency. Among the approaches to tackle the problem of image restoration, nonlinear anisotropic diffusion _cite_ defines a class of efficient approaches, as each diffusion step merely contains the convolution operation with a few linear filters. A nonlinear diffusion process usually corresponds to certain Partial Differential Equation (PDE) formulation. However, up to now, the image restoration quality of diffusion based approaches is still far away from the state-of-the-art, although with many improvements _cite_ . We give a brief review of nonlinear diffusion based approaches and then introduce our proposed diffusion model. In the seminal work _cite_, Perona and Malik (P-M) demonstrated that nonlinear diffusion models yield very impressive results for image processing. This has given rise to many revised models with various formulations. A notable variant is the so-called biased anisotropic diffusion (also known as reaction diffusion) proposed by Nordstr {\"o} m _cite_, which introduces a bias term (forcing term) to free the user from the difficulty of specifying an appropriate stopping time for the P-M diffusion process. This additional term reacts against the strict smoothing effect of the pure P-M diffusion, therefore resulting in a nontrivial steady-state. Tsiotsios \etal _cite_ discussed the choice of some crucial parameters in the P-M model, such as the diffusivity function, the gradient threshold parameter and the stopping time of the iterative process. Some works consider modification to the diffusion term or the reaction term for the reaction diffusion model _cite_, \eg, Acton \etal _cite_ and Plonkna \etal _cite_ exploited a more complicated reaction term to enhance oriented textures; _cite_ proposed to replace the ordinary diffusion term with a flow equation based on mean curvature. Gilboa \etal _cite_ proposed a forward and backward diffusion process, which incorporates explicit inverse diffusion with negative diffusivity coefficient by carefully choosing the diffusivity function. The resultant diffusion processes can adaptively switch between forward and backward diffusion process. In a latter work _cite_, the theoretical foundations for discrete forward-and-backward diffusion filtering were investigated. Researchers also propose to exploit higher-order nonlinear diffusion filtering, which involves larger linear filters, \eg, fourth-order diffusion models _cite_ . Meanwhile, theoretical properties about the stability and local feature enhancement of higher-order nonlinear diffusion filtering are established in _cite_ . It should be noted that all the above mentioned diffusion processes are handcrafted models. It is a generally difficult task to design a good-performing PDE for a specific image processing problem because good insights into this problem and a deep understanding of the behavior of the PDEs are usually required. Therefore, some researcher propose to learn PDEs from training data via an optimal control approach _cite_ . Unfortunately, at present _cite_ is the sole previous work we can find in this direction. The basic idea of our approach is the same as _cite_, but we go much further and our proposed model is much more expressive. In this paper we focus on nonlinear diffusion process due to its high efficiency and propose a trainable nonlinear diffusion model, which is parameterized by the linear filters and the influence functions. The trained diffusion model contains many special influence functions (see Fig. _ref_ for an illustration), which greatly differ from usual influence functions employed in conventional diffusion models. It turns out that the trained diffusion processes can lead to effective image restoration with state-of-the-art performance, while preserve the property of high efficiency of diffusion based approaches. At present, we are not aware of any previous works that simultaneously optimize the linear filters and influence functions of a nonlinear diffusion process . Our proposed nonlinear diffusion process has several remarkable benefits as follows: \vspace* {-N} \vspace* {-N}
