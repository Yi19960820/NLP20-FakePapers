Recently, scene text detection has drawn great attention from computer vision and machine learning community. Driven by many content-based image applications such as photo translation and receipt content recognition, it has become a promising and challenging research area both in academia and industry. Detecting text in natural images is difficult, because both text and background may be complex in the wild and it often suffers from disturbance such as occlusion and uncontrollable lighting conditions _cite_ . Previous text detection methods _cite_ have achieved promising results on several benchmarks. The essential problem in text detection is to represent text region using discriminative features. Conventionally, hand-crafted features are designed _cite_ to capture the properties of text region such as texture and shape, while in the past few years, deep learning based approaches _cite_ directly learn hierarchical features from training data, demonstrating more accurate and efficient performance in various benchmarks such as ICDAR series contests _cite_ . Existing methods _cite_ have obtained decent performance for detecting horizontal or near-horizontal text. While horizontal text detection has constraints of axis-aligned bounding-box ground truth, the multi-oriented text is not restrictive to a particular orientation and usually uses quadrilaterals for annotations. Therefore, it reports relatively lower accuracies in ICDAR N Competition Challenge N “Incidental scene text localization” _cite_ compared to horizontal scene text detection benchmarks _cite_ . Recently, a few approaches _cite_ have been proposed to address the multi-oriented text detection. In general, there are currently four different types of methods. Region based methods _cite_ leverage advanced object detection techniques such as Faster RCNN _cite_ and SSD _cite_ . Segmentation-based methods _cite_ mainly utilize fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) for generating text score maps, which often need several stages and components to achieve final detections. Direct regression based method _cite_ regresses the position and size of an object from a given point. Finally, hybrid method _cite_ combines text scores map and rotated/quadrangle bounding boxes generation to collaboratively obtain the efficient and accurate performance in multi-oriented text detection. Inspired by recent advance of instance-aware semantic segmentation _cite_, we present a novel perspective to handle the task of multi-oriented text detection. In this work, we leverage the merits from accurate region proposal based methods _cite_, and flexible segmentation based methods which can easily generate arbitrary-shaped text mask _cite_ . It is an end-to-end trainable framework excluding redundant and low-efficient pipelines such as the use of text/nontext salient map _cite_ and text-line generation _cite_ . Based on region proposal network (RPN), our approach detects and segments text instance simultaneously, followed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) to suppress overlapping instances. Finally, a minimum quadrangle bounding box to fit each instance area is generated as the result of the whole detection process. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
