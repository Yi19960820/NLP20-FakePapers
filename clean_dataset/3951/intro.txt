Injuries of the spine and its posterior elements in particular (see Figure _ref_) are a common occurrence in traumatic patients, with potentially devastating consequences _cite_ . Spine fractures are detected using volumetric imaging such as computed tomography (CT) in order to access the degree of injury. Spine injuries are a critical concern in blunt trauma, particularly in cases of motor vehicle collision and fall from significant heights. More than N, N vertebral fractures occur in the U.S. each year _cite_ . However, the traditional method of qualitative visual assessment of images for diagnosis could miss fractures, and is time-consuming, potentially causing delays in time-critical situations such as the treatment of spine injuries. Computer-aided detection (CADe) has the potential to expedite the assessment of trauma cases, reduce the chance of misclassification of fractures of the spine, and decrease inter-observer variability. Furthermore, CADe could help assess the stability and chronicity of fractures, as well as facilitate research into optimization of treatment paradigms.
