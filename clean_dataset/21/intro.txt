Face detection is a long-standing problem in computer vision with extensive applications including face alignment, face analysis, face recognition, etc. Starting from the pioneering work of Viola-Jones~ _cite_, face detection has made great progress. The performances on several well-known datasets have been improved consistently, even tend to be saturated. To further improve the performance of face detection has become a challenging issue. In our opinion, there remains room for improvement in two aspects: (a): number of false positives needs to be reduced at the high recall rates; (b): accuracy of the bounding box location needs to be improved. These two problems are elaborated as follows. On the one hand, the average precision (AP) of current face detection algorithms is already very high, but the precision is not high enough at high recall rates, \eg, as shown in Figure _ref_ of RetinaNet~ _cite_, the precision is only about _inline_eq_ (half of detections are false positives) when the recall rate is equal to _inline_eq_, which we define as the . Reflected on the shape of the Precision-Recall curve, it has extended far enough to the right, but not steep enough. The reason is that existing algorithms pay more attention to pursuing high recall rate but ignore the problem of excessive false positives. Analyzing with anchor-based face detectors, they detect faces by classifying and regressing a series of preset anchors, which are generated by regularly tiling a collection of boxes with different scales and aspect ratios. To detect the tiny faces, \eg, less than _inline_eq_ pixels, it is necessary to tile plenty of small anchors over the image. This can improve the recall rate yet cause the the extreme class imbalance problem, which is the culprit leading to excessive false positives. To address this issue, researchers propose several solutions. R-CNN-like detectors~ _cite_ address the class imbalance by a two-stage cascade and sampling heuristics. As for single-shot detectors, RetinaNet proposes the focal loss to focus training on a sparse set of hard examples and down-weight the loss assigned to well-classified examples. RefineDet~ _cite_ addresses this issue using a preset threshold to filter out negative anchors. However, RetinaNet takes all the samples into account, which also leads to quite a few false positives. Although RefineDet filters out a large number of simple negative samples, it uses hard negative mining in both two steps, and does not make full use of negative samples. Thus, the recall efficiency of them both can be improved. On the other hand, the location accuracy in the face detection task is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. Although current evaluation criteria of most face detection datasets~ _cite_ do not focus on the location accuracy, the WIDER Face Challenge adopts MS COCO~ _cite_ evaluation criterion, which puts more emphasis on bounding box location accuracy. To visualize this issue, we use different IoU thresholds to evaluate our trained face detector based on RetinaNet on the WIDER FACE dataset. As shown in Figure _ref_, as the IoU threshold increases, the AP drops dramatically, indicating that the accuracy of the bounding box location needs to be improved. To this end, Gidaris et al.~ _cite_ propose iterative regression during inference to improve the accuracy. Cascade R-CNN~ _cite_ addresses this issue by cascading R-CNN with different IoU thresholds. RefineDet~ _cite_ applies two-step regression to single-shot detector. However, blindly adding multi-step regression to the specific task (\ie, face detection) is often counterproductive. In this paper, we investigate the effects of two-step classification and regression on different levels of detection layers and propose a novel face detection framework, named Selective Refinement Network (SRN), which selectively applies two-step classification and regression to specific levels of detection layers. The network structure of SRN is shown in Figure _ref_, which consists of two key modules, named as the Selective Two-step Classification (STC) module and the Selective Two-step Regression (STR) module. Specifically, the STC is applied to filter out most simple negative samples (illustrated in Figure _ref_) from the low levels of detection layers, which contains _inline_eq_ samples. As shown in Figure _ref_, RetinaNet with STC improves the recall efficiency to a certain extent. On the other hand, the design of STR draws on the cascade idea to coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors (illustrated in Figure _ref_) from high levels of detection layers to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. In addition, we design a Receptive Field Enhancement (RFE) to provide more diverse receptive fields to better capture the extreme-pose faces. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB, and WIDER FACE benchmarks and we set a new state-of-the-art performance. In summarization, we have made the following main contributions to the face detection studies:
