Designing a logo is a long, complicated, and expensive process for any designer. However, recent advancements in generative algorithms provide models that could offer a possible solution. Logos are multi-modal, have very few categorical properties, and do not have a continuous latent space. Yet, conditional generative adversarial networks can be used to generate logos that could help designers in their creative process. We propose LoGAN: an improved auxiliary classifier Wasserstein generative adversarial neural network (with gradient penalty) that is able to generate logos conditioned on twelve different colors. In N generated instances (N classes and N logos per class), when looking at the most prominent color, the conditional generation part of the model has an overall precision and recall of N and N respectively. LoGAN's results offer a first glance at how artificial intelligence can be used to assist designers in their creative process and open promising future directions, such as including more descriptive labels which will provide a more exhaustive and easy-to-use system.
