Historically, multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard method on detailed whole brain segmentation (_inline_eq_ N anatomical regions) due to its high accuracy. Moreover, MAS only demands a small number of manually labeled examples (atlases) _cite_ . Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been applied to whole brain segmentation. To address the challenges of training a network on a small number of manually traced brains, patch-based DCNN methods have been proposed. de Brébisson et al., _cite_ proposed to learn ND and ND patches as well as spatial information, which was extended to include N patches by BrainSegNet _cite_ . Recently, DeepNAT _cite_ was proposed to perform hierarchical multi-task learning on ND patches. Li et al., _cite_ introduced the ND patch-based HC Net for high resolution segmentation. From another perspective, Roy et al., _cite_ proposed to use ND fully convolutional network (FCN) to learn slice-wise image features by using auxiliary labels on initially unlabeled data. Although detailed cortical parcellations were not performed, Roy et al., revealed a promising direction on how to use initially unlabeled data to leverage training. With a large number of auxiliary labels, it is appealing to perform ND FCN (e.g., ND U-Net _cite_) on whole brain segmentation since it typically yields higher spatial consistency than ND or patch-based methods. However, directly applying ND FCN to whole brain segmentation (e.g., Nmm isotropic resolution) is restricted by the current graphics processing unit (GPU) memory. A common solution is to down sample the inputs, yet, the accuracy can be sacrificed. In this paper, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method for detailed whole brain segmentation (N labels under BrainCOLOR protocol _cite_) by combining canonical medical image processing techniques with deep learning. SLANT distributes a set of independent ND networks (“network tiles”) to cover overlapped sub-spaces in a standard MNI atlas space _cite_ . Then, majority vote label fusion was used to obtain final whole brain segmentation from the overlapped sub-spaces. To leverage learning performance on N labels with only N manually traced training data, auxiliary labels on N initially unlabeled scans were created from non-local spatial STAPLE (NLSS) MAS _cite_ for pre-training inspired by _cite_ .
