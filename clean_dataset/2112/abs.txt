Recently, facial attribute classification (FAC) has attracted significant attention in the computer vision community. Great progress has been made along with the availability of challenging FAC datasets. However, conventional FAC methods usually firstly pre-process the input images (i.e., perform face detection and alignment) and then predict facial attributes. These methods ignore the inherent dependencies among these tasks (i.e., face detection, facial landmark localization and FAC) . Moreover, some methods using convolutional neural network are trained based on the fixed loss weights without considering the differences between facial attributes. In order to address the above problems, we propose a novel multi-task learning of cascaded convolutional neural network method, termed MCFA, for predicting multiple facial attributes simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed method takes advantage of three cascaded sub-networks (i.e., S \_Net, M \_Net and L \_Net corresponding to the neural networks under different scales) to jointly train multiple tasks in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can achieve end-to-end optimization. Furthermore, the proposed method automatically assigns the loss weight to each facial attribute based on a novel dynamic weighting scheme, thus making the proposed method concentrate on predicting the more difficult facial attributes. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art FAC methods on the challenging CelebA and LFWA datasets.
