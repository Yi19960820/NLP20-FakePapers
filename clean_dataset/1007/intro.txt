Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide (only second to cataracts), as well as the foremost cause of irreversible blindness~ _cite_ . Since vision loss from glaucoma cannot be reversed, early screening and detection methods are essential to preserve vision and life quality. One major glaucoma screening technique is optic nerve head (ONH) assessment, which employs a binary classification to identify the glaucomatous and healthy subjects~ _cite_ . However, the manual assessment by trained clinicians is time consuming and costly, and not suitable for population screening. For large-scale screening, automatic ONH assessment methods are needed. Some clinical measurements are proposed, such as the vertical cup to disc ratio (CDR) ~ _cite_, rim to disc area ratio (RDAR), and disc diameter~ _cite_ . In them, CDR is well accepted and commonly used by clinicians. In color fundus image, the optic disc (OD) appears as a bright yellowish elliptical region, and can be divided into two distinct zones: a central bright zone as optic cup (OC) and a peripheral region as the neuroretinal rim, as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . The CDR is calculated by the ratio of vertical cup diameter (VCD) to vertical disc diameter (VDD) . In general, a larger CDR suggests a higher risk of glaucoma and vice versa. Accurate segmentations of OD and OC are essential for CDR measurement. Some methods automatically measure the disc and cup from N-D optical coherence tomography (OCT) ~ _cite_ . However, OCT is not easily available due to its high cost, the fundus image is still referred to by most clinicians. A number of works have been proposed to segment the OD and/or OC from the fundus image~ _cite_ . The main segmentation techniques include color and contrast thresholding, boundary detection, and region segmentation methods~ _cite_ . In these methods, the pixels or patches of fundus images are determined as background, disc and cup regions, through a learned classifier with various visual features. However, most existing methods are based on hand-crafted features (e.g., RGB color, texture, Gabor filter, and gradient), which lack sufficiently discriminative representations and are easily affected by pathological regions and low contrast quality. In addition, most methods segment the OD and OC separately, i.e., segmenting OD first, followed by the OC without considering the mutual relation of them. In this paper, we consider OD and OC together, and provide a one-stage framework based on deep learning technique. Deep learning techniques have been recently demonstrated to yield highly discriminative representations that have aided in many computer vision tasks. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have brought heightened performance in image classification~ _cite_ and segmentation~ _cite_ . For retinal image, Gulshan~ et al. have demonstrated that the deep learning system could obtain a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy~ _cite_ . In fundus vessel segmentation, the deep learning systems~ _cite_ also achieve the state-of-the-art performances. These successes have motivated our investigation of deep learning for disc and cup segmentation from fundus images. In our paper, we address OD and OC segmentation as a multi-label task and solve it using a novel end-to-end deep network. The main contributions of our work include: The remainders of this paper are organized as follows. We begin by reviewing techniques related to OD/OC segmentation in Section~ _ref_ . The details of our system and its components are presented in Section~ _ref_ . To verify the efficacy of our method, extensive experiments are conducted in Section~ _ref_, and then we conclude with final remarks in Section~ _ref_ .
