The generation of dense, ND-point clouds from overhead sensing systems is growing in scope and scale through processes such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), dense stereo-or multiview-photogrammetry and, in the computer vision domain, structure from motion (SfM) . Despite the prevalence of ND-point cloud data, however, automated interpretation and knowledge discovery from ND-data remains challenging due to the irregular structure of raw point clouds. As such, exploitation has typically been limited to simple visualization and basic mensuration ; or, the point cloud is rasterized onto a more tractable N-digital surface model (DSM) from which conventional image processing techniques are applied, \eg~ . In order to generate exploitation-ready data products directly from the point cloud, semantic classification is desired. Similar to per-pixel image labeling, ND-semantic labeling seeks to attribute a semantic classification label to each ND-point. Classification labels, \eg~ vegetation, building, road, etc., can subsequently be used to inform derivative processing efforts, such as surface fitting, ND modeling, object detection, and bare-earth extraction.
