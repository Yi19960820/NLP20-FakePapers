Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images collected with airborne and satellite sensors are a wealthy source of information concerning the Earth's surface, and have been widely used in urban planning, agriculture assessment and environment monitoring _cite_ . These applications require the fully understanding and interpretation of PolSAR images. Hence, PolSAR image interpretation is of much significance in theory and application. Land use classification of PolSAR images are an important and indispensable research topic since these images contain rich character of the target (e.g., scattering properties, geometric shapes, and the direction of arrival) . The land use classification is arranging the pixels to the different categories according to the certain rule. The common objects within the PolSAR images include land, buildings, water, sand, urban areas, vegetation, road, bridge and so on _cite_ . In order to distinguish them, the features of the pixels should be fully extracted and mined. With the development of the PolSAR image classification, many feature extraction algorithms based on physical scattering mechanisms have been introduced. The feature extraction techniques based on polarimetric characteristics can be divided into two kinds: coherent target decomposition and incoherent target decomposition. The former acts on the scattering matrix to characterize completely polarized scattered waves, which contains the fully polarimetric information. The latter acts only on the mueller matrix, covariance matrix, or coherency matrix in order to characterize partially polarized waves _cite_ . The coherent target decomposition algorithms include the Pauli decomposition, the sphere-diplane-helix (SDH) decomposition _cite_, the symmetric scattering characterization method (SSCM) _cite_, Cameron decomposition _cite_, Yamaguchi Four-component scattering power decomposition _cite_, General polarimetric model-based decomposition _cite_, and some advances _cite_ . The incoherent target decomposition algorithms include Huynen decomposition _cite_, Freeman-Durden decomposition _cite_, Yamguchi four-component decomposition _cite_, Cloude-Pottier decomposition _cite_, _cite_, and a number of approaches have been reported _cite_ . In addition to feature based on the polarization mechanism _cite_, there are some traditional features of natural images, which have been utilized to analyze PolSAR image, such as color features _cite_, texture features _cite_, spatial relations _cite_, etc. Based on the above basic features, some multiple features of PolSAR data have been constructed to improve the classification performance _cite_ . For classification tasks, besides the feature extraction, classifier design is also a key point. According to the degree of data mark, the classification methods can be broadly divided into three groups, including unsupervised classification (without any labeled training data), semi-supervised classification (SSC) (with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data) and supervised classification (with completely labeled training data) _cite_ . The unsupervised classification approaches design a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data. The traditional methods always make a decision rule to cluster PolSAR data into different groups, and the number of groups is also a hyper-parameter. There are a lot of unsupervised classification methods for PolSAR data, such as H/ _inline_eq_ complex Wishart classifier _cite_, polarimetric scattering characteristics preserved method _cite_, Fuzzy k-means cluster classifier _cite_, the classification based on deep learning _cite_, etc. The SSC is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also make use of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training. Compared with the unsupervised method, SSC can improve classification performance so long as the target is to make full use of a smaller number of labeled samples _cite_ . There are many semi-supervised classification for PolSAR data, such as the classification based on hypergraph learning _cite_, the method based on parallel auction graph _cite_, spatial-anchor graph _cite_, etc. Unlike unsupervised approaches and semi-supervised approaches, the supervised classifications use enough labeled samples to train the classifiers which can be applied to determine the class of other samples. Lots of methods have been introduced, including maximum likelihood _cite_, support vector machines _cite_, sparse representation _cite_, deep learning _cite_ . Recently, deep learning has attracted considerable attention in the computer vision community _cite_, as it provides an efficient way to learn image features and to represent certain function classes far more efficiently than shallow ones _cite_, _cite_, _cite_ . Deep learning has also been introduced into the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) community _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_ . Especially in the direction of PolSAR image classification, in _cite_, a specific deep model for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) image classification is proposed, which is named as Wishart deep stacking network (W-DSN) . A fast implementation of Wishart distance is achieved by a special linear transformation, which speeds up the classification of POLSAR image. In _cite_, a new type of restricted boltzmann machine (RBM) is specially defined, which we name the Wishart-Bernoulli RBM (WBRBM), and is used to form a deep network named as Wishart Deep Belief Networks (W-DBN) . In _cite_, a new type of autoencoder (AE) and convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is specially defined, which we name them Wishart-AE (WAE) and Wishart-CAE (WCAE) . In _cite_, a complex-valued CNN (CV-CNN) specifically for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image interpretation. It utilizes both amplitude and phase information of complex SAR imagery. In _cite_, Si-Wei Chen, Xue-Song Wang and Motoyuki Sato proposed a polarimetric-feature-driven deep convolutional neural network (PFDCN) for PolSAR image classification. The core idea of which is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN classifier training and improve the final classification performance. What is more, fullly convolutional network (FCN) is successfully used for natural image semantic segmentation _cite_ and remote sense image classification based on one by one pixel _cite_ . In _cite_, a fully convolutional neural network is trained to segment water on Landsat imagery. In _cite_, a novel deep model, i.e., a cascaded end-to-end convolutional neural network (CasNet), was proposed to simultaneously cope with the road detection and centerline extraction tasks. Specifically, CasNet consists of two networks. One aims at the road detection task. The other is cascaded to the former one, making full use of the feature maps produced formerly, to obtain the good centerline extraction. In _cite_, a novel hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) framework, named deep multiscale spatial-spectral feature extraction algorithm, was proposed based on fully convolutional neural network. In _cite_, the authors presented a CNN-based system relying on a downsample-then-upsample architecture. Specifically, it first learns a rough spatial map of high-level representations by means of convolutions and then learns to upsample them back to the original resolution by deconvolution. By doing so, the CNN learns to densely label every pixel at the original resolution of the image. Inspired by the previous research works, a supervised PolSAR image classification method based on polarimetric scattering coding and convolution network is proposed in this paper. Our goal is to solve the problems of PolSAR data coding, feature extraction, and land cover classification. Our work can be summarized into three main parts as follows.
