Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables noninvasive investigation of brain connectivity and tissue microstructure by capturing the anisotropic water diffusion in tissue. The diffusion profile can be described by the ensemble average propagator ~ (EAP), where both directional and scalar properties of tissue can be derived~ _cite_ . Various methods have been proposed to estimate the EAP. For example, diffusion spectrum imaging ~ (DSI) densely samples the _inline_eq_-space and takes the inverse Fourier transform of the normalized diffusion signals to compute the EAP. However, DSI uses a large number of measurements, which requires a long acquisition time and is impractical for clinical use. Therefore, to reduce the number of required measurements, methods have been developed to model the diffusion signals with an adequate basis, and EAP estimation is equivalent to the estimation of basis coefficients~ _cite_ . Deep learning has been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks~ _cite_, including the computation of some diffusion properties~ _cite_ . In~ _cite_, a multiple layer perceptron ~ (MLP) has been used to predict scalar diffusion features, such as tissue microstructure and diffusion kurtosis, and the quality of estimation is improved. However, extending the MLP structure to estimate the EAP---i.e., a vector of basis coefficients---is not trivial, because the coefficients could lie in a non-Euclidean space. Typically used training error measures, such as mean squared errors, may not properly define the difference between the estimated and training EAPs, which in practice causes problems in particular for the extraction of directional information from the EAP. In this work, we propose a deep learning algorithm for EAP estimation, which is named learning-based ensemble average propagator estimation ~ (LEAPE) . We select the SHORE basis for demonstration, which allows closed-form computation of some diffusion features~ _cite_ . LEAPE comprises two cascaded components. The first component is an MLP that simultaneously predicts the basis coefficients. Then, using the output of the first component and the training EAPs, we compute an auxiliary output of fiber orientation ~ (FO) errors in the second component to regularize the training. Since the computation of the FO error is complex and its gradient is hard to compute for training, the FO error is approximated with the aid of a second MLP, which is trained separately. The network was trained using dMRI data densely sampling the _inline_eq_-space and evaluated on dMRI data resembling clinically achievable _inline_eq_-space sampling. Promising results were observed compared with conventional EAP estimation.
