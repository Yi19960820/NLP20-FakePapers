Although face detection has been extensively studied during the past two decades, detecting unconstrained faces in images and videos has not yet been convincingly solved. Most classic and recent deep learning methods tend to detect faces where fine-grained facial parts are clearly visible. This negatively affects their detection performance in the case of faces at low-resolution or out-of-focus blur, which are common issues in surveillance camera data. The lack of progress in this regard is largely due to the fact that current face detection benchmark datasets (e.g., FDDB~ _cite_, PACAL FACE~ _cite_ and AFW~ _cite_) are biased towards high-resolution face images with limited variations in scale, pose, occlusion, illumination, out-of-focus blur and background clutter. Recently, a new face detection benchmark dataset, WIDER FACE~ _cite_, has been released to tackle this problem. WIDER FACE consists of N, N images with N, N labeled faces. Images in WIDER FACE also have the highest degree of variations in scale, pose, occlusion, lighting conditions, and image blur. As indicated in the WIDER FACE report~ _cite_, of all the factors that affect face detection performance, scale is the most significant. In view of the challenge created by facial scale variation in face detection, we propose a Multi-Path Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (MP-RCNN) to detect big faces and tiny faces with high accuracy. At the same time, it is noteworthy that by virtue of the abundant feature representation power of deep neural networks and the employment of contextual information, our method also possesses a high level of robustness to other factors. These are a consequence of variations in pose, occlusion, illumination, out-of-focus blur and background clutter, as shown in Figure N. MP-RCNN is composed of two stages. The first stage is a Multi-Path Region Proposal Network (MP-RPN) that proposes faces at three different scales: small (N-N pixels in height), medium (N-N pixels in height) and large (N-N pixels in height) . These scales cover the majority of faces available in all public face detection databases, e.g., WIDER FACE~ _cite_, FDDB~ _cite_, PASCAL FACE~ _cite_ and AFW~ _cite_ . We observe that the feature maps of lower-level convolutional layers are most sensitive to small-scale face patterns, but almost agnostic to large-scale face patterns due to a limited receptive field. Conversely, the feature maps of the higher-level convolutional layers respond strongly to large-scale face patterns while ignoring small-scale patterns. On the basis of this observation, we simultaneously utilize three parallel outputs of the convolutional feature maps to predict multi-scale candidate face regions. We note that the path of medium-scale (N-N) and large-scale (N-N) span a much larger scale range than the small-scale (N-N) path does. Thus we additionally employ the so-called ``atrous'' convolution trick (convolution with up-sampled filters) ~ _cite_ together with normal convolution to acquire a larger field of view so as to comprehensively cover the particular face scale range. Moreover, a newly proposed sampling layer is embedded in MP-RPN to further boost the discriminative power of the network for difficult face/non-face patterns. To further contend with difficult false positives while including difficult false negatives, we add a second stage Boosted Forests classifier after MP-RPN. The Boosted Forests classifier utilizes deep facial features pooled from inside the candidate face regions. It also invokes deep contextual features pooled from a larger region surrounding candidate face regions to make a more precise prediction of face/non-face patterns. Our MP-RCNN achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on both the WIDER FACE~ _cite_ and FDDB ~ _cite_ datasets. In particular, on the most challenging so-called ``hard'' partition of the WIDER FACE test set that contains just small faces, we outperform the former best result by N \% for the Average Precision. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section N reviews related work. Section N introduces the proposed MP-RCNN approach to the problem of unconstrained face detection. Section N presents experimental results to demonstrate the rationale behind our network design and compares our method with other state-of-the-art face detection algorithms on the WIDER FACE~ _cite_ and FDDB~ _cite_ datasets. Section N concludes the paper and proposes future work.
