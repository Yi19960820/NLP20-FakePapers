One of the fundamental tasks in the field of computer vision is image matching, which plays an important role in some large tasks, such as image retrieval _cite_, robot navigation _cite_ and texture classification _cite_ . The general idea explored here is to learn a embedding vector for each image by using deep neural network, especially, the deep convolutional neural network _cite_ . Traditionally, siamese architecture are widely adopted _cite_ . The principle of this method is shown in Figure N, the positive distance (DN) between the descriptor of similar images is reduced, while the negative distances (DN, DN) between descriptor of different images are enlarged, by optimizing the weights of the siamese network. In this way, different images can be dispersed to the greatest extent in the embedding space. And some other tasks can be also accomplished by the descriptor, including image clustering, face verification and semantic similarity. Although deep learning subverts traditional methods in the tasks of computer vision such as target detection _cite_, image classification _cite_ and face recognition _cite_, the majority successful approaches focus on the exploration of the real number field, including compressing models _cite_, improving architecture and perfecting loss _cite_ . With the reported of complex blocks _cite_, the new solutions for the problem of the initialization, the batch normalization _cite_ and the activation function of complex network are available. Deep learning based on complex-valued are increasingly focused by researchers. According to _cite_, there is a potential in complex network to enable easier learning, better generalization characteristics and to allow for preservation of detached detail. In the encoding network based on real-valued, details of the image may be lost due to improper length of descriptor. But in the complex-valued network, the phase value of descriptor vector can help the decoder recover it. Recent works have shown that, phase value provides a detailed description of objects because it contains the information of shapes, edges, and orientations of images _cite_ . In order to make full use of the advantage of complex-valued feature representation in the complex field, we propose the distance metric of the complex vector, improve the triple loss for the complex numbers, and apply it to the learning of image matching and descriptor. Our main contributions in this paper are as follows: N.We propose the complex triple network, which is used to extract complex descriptors. N.We utilize N-ch net _cite_ to process the real part and the imaginary part of complex feature. N.We present a new metric formula of the complex-valued embedding distance, which is referenced to the 	absolute distance. N.We achieve a competitive performance result in the task of image patches comparing on the Photo-Tour and HPatches dataset.
