The significant increase of satellite imagery has given a radically improved understanding of our planet. Object recognition in aerial imagery enjoys growing interest today, due to the recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning, along with important improvements in low-cost high-performance GPUs. The possibility of accurately distinguishing different types of objects in aerial images, such as buildings, roads, vegetation and other categories, could greatly help in many applications, such as creating and keeping up-to-date maps, improving urban planning, environment monitoring, and disaster relief. Besides the practical need for accurate aerial image interpretation systems, this domain also offers scientific challenges to the computer vision. In this paper, we describe and analyze these challenges for the specific satellite imagery dataset from a Kaggle competition. We explore the challenges faced due to the small size of the dataset, the specific character of data, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms that are suitable for this kind of problems. Our efforts can be summarized as follows:
