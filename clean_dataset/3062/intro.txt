A fundamental challenge in intelligent video surveillance is to automatically detect abnormal events in long video streams. This problem has attracted considerable attentions from both academia and industry in recent years _cite_ . Video anomaly detection is also important as it is related to other interesting topics in computer vision, such as dominant behavior detection~ _cite_, visual saliency~ _cite_ and interestingness prediction~ _cite_ . A typical approach to tackle the anomaly detection task is to learn a model which describes normal activities in the video scene and then discovers unusual events by examining patterns which distinctly diverge from the model. However, the complexity of scenes and the deceptive nature of abnormal behaviours make anomaly detection still a very challenging task. Among previous works, several anomaly detection approaches are based on analyzing individual moving objects in the scene. Tracking is usually an initial step for this class of methods. By using accurate tracking algorithms, trajectory extraction can be carried out to further perform trajectory clustering analysis~ _cite_ or design representative features _cite_ to model typical activities and subsequently discover anomalies. In _cite_, trajectories which are spatially close and have similar motion patterns are identified and used for detecting unusual events. Vaswani \etal~ _cite_ propose a ``shape activity'' model to describe moving objects and detect anomalies. However, as tracking performance significantly degrades in the presence of several occluded targets, tracking-based methods are not suitable for analyzing complex and crowded scenes. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, researchers address the problem by learning spatio/temporal activity patterns in a local or a global context from either ND image cells or ND video volumes~ _cite_ . This category of methods builds the models based on hand-crafted features extracted from low-level appearance and motion cues, such as color, texture and optical flow. Commonly used low-level features include histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), ND spatio-temporal gradient, histogram of optical flow (HOF), among others. Cong \etal~ _cite_ employ multi-scale histograms of optical flow and a sparse coding model and use the reconstruction error as a metric for outlier detection. Mehran \etal~ _cite_ propose a ``social force'' model based on optical flow features to represent crowd activity patterns and identify anomalous activities. In~ _cite_ co-occurrence statistics of spatio-temporal events are employed in combination with Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to discover unusual activities. Kratz \etal~ _cite_ introduce a HMMs-based approach for detecting abnormal events by analyzing the motion variation of local space-time volumes. Kim \etal~ _cite_ propose a method based on local optical flow features and MRFs to spot unusual events. Mahadevan \etal~ _cite_ introduce a mixtures of dynamic textures model to jointly employ appearance and motion features. However, the adoption of hand-crafted features is a clear limitation of previous methods, as it implies enforcing some some a priori knowledge which, in case of complex video surveillance scene, is very difficult to define. Recently, deep learning architectures have been successfully used to tackle various computer vision tasks, such as image classification~ _cite_, object detection _cite_ and activity recognition~ _cite_ . However, these works are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks and consider a supervised learning scenario. Unsupervised deep learning approaches based on autoencoder networks~ have also been investigated to address important tasks such as object tracking~ _cite_ and face alignment~ _cite_ . The key of the success is that, using deep architectures, rich and discriminative features can be learned via multi-layer nonlinear transformations. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that detecting unusual events in videos can also benefit from deep learning models. Following this intuition, in this paper we propose a novel Appearance and Motion DeepNet (AMDN) framework for discovering anomalous activities in complex video surveillance scenes. Opposite to previous works~ _cite_, instead of using hand-crafted features to model activity patterns, we propose to learn discriminative feature representations of both appearance and motion patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. A novel approach based on stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) ~ _cite_ is introduced to achieve this goal. An overview of the proposed AMDN is shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . Low-level visual information including still image patches and dynamic motion fields represented with optical flow is used as input of two separate networks, to first learn appearance and motion features, respectively. To further investigate the correlations between appearance and motion, early fusion is performed by combining image pixels with their corresponding optical flow to learn a joint representation. Finally, for abnormal event prediction, a late fusion strategy is introduced to combine the anomaly scores predicted by multiple one-class SVM classifiers, each corresponding to one of the three learned feature representations. The benefits of the proposed double fusion framework (\ie combining both early fusion and late fusion strategies) are confirmed by our extensive experimental evaluation, conducted on two publicly available datasets. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: i) As far as we know, we are the first to introduce an unsupervised deep learning framework to automatically construct discriminative representations for video anomaly detection. ii) We propose a new approach to learn appearance and motion features as well as their correlations. Deep learning methods for combining multiple modalities have been investigated in previous works _cite_ . However, to our knowledge, this is the first work where multimodal deep learning is applied to anomalous event detection. iii) A double fusion scheme is proposed to combine appearance and motion features for discovering unusual activities. It is worth noting that the advantages of combining early and late fusion approaches have been investigated in previous works _cite_ . However, Lan \etal. _cite_ do not consider a deep learning framework. iv) The proposed method is validated on challenging anomaly detection datasets and we obtain very competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art.
