In this work, we propose a method to decompose unconstrained real world faces into shape, reflectance and illuminance assuming lambertian reflectance. This decomposition or inverse rendering is a classical and fundamental problem in computer vision _cite_ . It allows one to edit an image, for example with re-lighting and light transfer _cite_ . Inverse rendering also has potential applications in Augmented Reality, where it is important to understand the illumination and reflectance of a human face. A major obstacle in solving this decomposition or any of its individual components for real images is the limited availability of ground-truth training data. Even though it is possible to collect real world facial shapes, it is extremely difficult to build a dataset of reflectance and illuminance of images in the wild at a large scale. Previous works have attempted to learn surface normal from synthetic data _cite_, which often performs imperfectly in the presence of real world variations like illumination and expression. Supervised learning can generalize poorly if real test data comes from a different distribution than the synthetic training data. We propose a solution to this challenge by jointly learning all intrinsic components of the decomposition from real data. In the absence of ground-truth supervision for real data, photometric reconstruction loss can be used to validate the decomposition. This photometric consistency between the original image and inferred normal, albedo and illuminance provide strong cues for inverse rendering. However it is not possible to learn from real images only with reconstruction loss, as this may cause the individual components to collapse on each other and produce trivial solutions. Thus, a natural step forward is to get the best of both worlds by simultaneously using supervised data when available and real world data with reconstruction loss in their absence. To this end we propose a training paradigm `SfS-supervision'. To achieve this goal we propose a novel deep architecture called SfSNet, which attempts to mimic the physical model of lambertian image generation while learning from a mixture of labeled synthetic and unlabeled real world images. Training from this mixed data allows the network to learn low frequency variations in facial geometry, reflectance and lighting from synthetic data while simultaneously understanding the high frequency details in real data using shading cues through reconstruction loss. This idea is motivated by the classical works in the Shape from Shading (SfS) literature where often a reference model is used to compensate for the low frequency variations and then shading cues are utilized for obtaining high frequency details _cite_ . To meet this goal we develop a decomposition architecture with residual blocks that learns a complete separation of image features into normals and albedo. Then we use normal, albedo and image features to regress the illumination parameters. This is based on the observation that in classical illumination modeling, lighting is estimated from image, normal and albedo by solving an over-constrained system of equations. Our network architecture is illustrated in Figure _ref_ . Our model and code is available for research purposes at {\small _url_} . We evaluate our approach on the real world CelebA dataset _cite_ and present extensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods _cite_, which also perform inverse rendering of faces. SfSNet produces significantly better reconstruction than _cite_ on the same images that are showcased in their papers. We further compare SfSNet with state-of-the-art methods that aim to solve for only one component of the inverse rendering such as normals or lighting. SfSNet outperforms a recent approach that estimates normal independently _cite_, by improving normal estimation accuracy by N \% (N \% to N \%) on the Photoface dataset _cite_, which contains faces captured under harsh lighting. We also compare against ‘PixNVertex’ _cite_, which only estimate high resolution meshes. We demonstrate that SfSNet reconstructions are significantly more robust to expression and illumination variation compared to ‘PixNVertex’. This results from the fact that we are jointly solving for all components, which allows us to train on real images through reconstruction loss. SfSNet outperforms `PixNVertex' (before meshing) by N \% (N \% to N \%) without training on the Photoface dataset. We also outperform a recent approach on lighting estimation `LDAN' _cite_ by N \% (N \% to N \%) . In summary our main contributions are as follows: _inline_eq_ We propose a network, SfSNet, inspired by a physical lambertian rendering model. This uses a decomposition architecture with residual blocks to separate image features into normal and albedo, further used to estimate lighting. _inline_eq_ We present a training paradigm `SfS-supervision', which allows learning from a mixture of labeled synthetic and unlabeled real world images. This allows us to jointly learn normal, albedo and lighting from real images via reconstruction loss, outperforming approaches that only learn an individual component. _inline_eq_ SfSNet produces remarkably better visual results compared to state-of-the-art methods for inverse rendering _cite_ . In comparison with methods that obtain one component of the inverse rendering _cite_, SfSNet is significantly better, especially for images with expression and non-ambient illumination.
