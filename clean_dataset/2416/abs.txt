Automatic brain tumor segmentation plays an important role for diagnosis, surgical planning and treatment assessment of brain tumors. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for this task. Due to the relatively small data set for training, data augmentation at training time has been commonly used for better performance of CNNs. Recent works also demonstrated the usefulness of data augmentation at test time, in addition to training time, for achieving more robust predictions. We investigate how test-time augmentation can improve CNNs' performance for brain tumor segmentation. We used different underpinning network structures and augmented the image by ND rotation, flipping, scaling and adding random noise at both training and test time. Experiments with BraTS N training and validation set show that test-time augmentation can achieve higher segmentation accuracy and obtain uncertainty estimation of the segmentation results.
