Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in women. Early detection and treatment are imperative for improving survival rates, which have steadily increased in recent years as a result of more sophisticated computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems. A critical component of breast cancer diagnosis relies on histopathology, a laborious and highly subjective process. Consequently, CAD systems are essential to reduce inter-rater variability and supplement the analyses conducted by specialists. In this paper, a transfer-learning based approach is proposed, for the task of breast histology image classification into four tissue sub-types, namely, normal, benign, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma. The histology images, provided as part of the BACH N grand challenge, were first normalized to correct for color variations resulting from inconsistencies during slide preparation. Subsequently, image patches were extracted and used to fine-tune Google`s Inception-VN and ResNetN convolutional neural networks (CNNs), both pre-trained on the ImageNet database, enabling them to learn domain-specific features, necessary to classify the histology images. The ResNetN network (based on residual learning) achieved a test classification accuracy of N \% for four classes, outperforming the Inception-VN network which achieved an accuracy of N
