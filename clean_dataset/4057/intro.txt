There has been so much activity in the field of affective computing that it already contributed to the creation of new research directions in affect analysis _cite_ . There are multiple research directions for analyzing human affect, including face data _cite_, audiovisual data _cite_, and body data _cite_ . One of the main challenges of affect analysis is that it does not occur in isolation. Humans usually couple affect with an action in natural interactions; for example, a person could be talking and smiling, or knocking on a door angrily as shown in Fig.~ _ref_ . To be able to recognize body action-affect pairs, efficient temporal algorithms are needed to capture the micro movements that differentiate between happy and sad as well as capture the macro variations between the different actions. The focus of our work is on single-view, multi-task action-affect recognition from skeleton data captured by motion capture or Kinect sensors. Our work leverages the knowledge and work done by the graphics and animation community _cite_ and uses machine learning to enhance it and make it accessible for a wide variety of applications. We use the Body Affect dataset produced by _cite_ and the Tower Game _cite_ dataset as the test cases for our novel multi-task approach. Time series analysis is a difficult problem that requires efficient modeling, because of the large amounts of data it introduces. There are multiple approaches that designed features to reduce the data dimensionality, using mid-level features, and then use a simpler model to do classification _cite_ . We depart from these methods by proposing a model that learns a shared representation using multi-task learning. For this paper we choose Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines, which are non-linear generative models for modeling time series data, as our building block. They use an undirected model with binary latent variables connected to a number of visible variables. A CRBM-based generative model enables modeling short-term phenomenon. We propose a new hybrid model that enhances the CRBM model with multi-task, discriminative, components based on the work of _cite_ . This work leads to a superior classification performance, while also allowing us to model temporal dynamics efficiently. We evaluate our approach on the Body Affect _cite_ and Tower Game _cite_ datasets and show how our results are superior to the state-of-the-art. In sec.~ _ref_ we discuss prior work. In sec.~ _ref_ we give a brief background of similar models that motivate our approach, followed by a description of our model. In sec.~ _ref_ we describe the inference algorithm. In sec.~ _ref_ we specify our learning algorithm. In sec.~ _ref_ we show quantitative results of our approach, followed by the conclusion in sec.~ _ref_ .
