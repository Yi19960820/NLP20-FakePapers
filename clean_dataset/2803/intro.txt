disease is one of the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Accurate estimation of cardiac indices from cardiac MR images plays a critical role in early diagnosis and identification of cardiac disease. Cardiac indices are quantitative anatomical or functional information (wall thickness, cavity area, myocardium area, and ejection fraction (EF), etc.) of the heart, which help distinguish between pathology and health~ _cite_ . Two categories of solutions exist for cardiac indices estimation: traditional methods~ _cite_ and direct methods~ _cite_ . Traditional methods rely on the premise of cardiac segmentation, from which cardiac indices are then manually measured. However, obtaining good and robust segmentation is still a great challenge due to the diverse structure and complicate temporal dynamics of cardiac sequences, therefore resulting requirements of strong prior information and user interaction~ _cite_ . To circumvent these limitations, direct methods without segmentation have grown in popularity in cardiac volumes estimation, and obtained effective performance benefiting from machine learning algorithms ~ _cite_ . Despite their effective performance for volume estimation, existing direct methods can not obtain satisfactory results for multitype cardiac indices estimation. N) They are not designed for estimation. Existing direct methods focus on estimation of volumes of ventricles and atriums only, whereas cardiac indices are far more than these volumes~ _cite_ . For other indices, such as wall thickness and myocardium area, more challenges compared to volume estimation arise (see Section~ _ref_) . N) They do not learn image representation and regression models jointly and cannot make them adapt to and benefit from each other maximally. Existing direct methods follow a two-phase framework, where image representation is usually based on task-unaware hand-crafted features and the regression model is then learned separately, therefore obtain only inferior performance. To provide an accurate and reliable solution for multitype cardiac indices estimation, we propose a semi-automated method based on an integrated deep neural network . It comprises two tightly-coupled networks: a deep convolution autoencoder (DCAE) for cardiac image representation, and a multiple output convolution neural network (CNN) for indices regression. When DCAE and CNN are learned jointly with proper initialization, Indices-Net can N) remarkably enhance the expressiveness of image representation and the compatibility between image representation and indices regression models; and N) simultaneously estimate with high accuracy two types of cardiac indices, i.e., linear indices (N regional myocardium wall thicknesses), and planar indices (areas of LV myocardium and cavity) . Experiments on N subjects show that Indices-Net achieves the lowest estimation error for linear indices (N _inline_eq_ N) and planar indices (N _inline_eq_ Nmm _inline_eq_) . Fig.~ _ref_ demonstrates how the proposed method differs from segmentation-based methods and existing two-phase volume-only direct methods. Two types of cardiac indices~ _cite_ that describe anatomical information are to be estimated: linear indices (i.e, regional wall thickness of LV myocardium) and planar indices (i.e, areas of LV cavity and myocardium), as demonstrated in the right of Fig.~ _ref_ . These indices are closely related to regional and global cardiac function assessment, respectively. Detailed definitions and clinical roles of more cardiac indices can be found in of~ _cite_ . Despite their clinical significance~ _cite_, multitype cardiac indices estimation has never been explored in existing direct methods~ _cite_ . These methods only focus on volume estimation, which can be simplified as integration of cavity area along the long axis and is less difficult to estimate due to the high contrast of the boundary between LV cavity and myocardium, and the high density of the cavity area in cardiac MR images. More challenges arise during estimation of the above mentioned multitype cardiac indices. N) Linear indices differ from planar ones in their relation with ND spatial image structures, therefore more relevant and robust image representation is required to estimate both of them. N) As for the specific indices, regional wall thicknesses and myocardium area are susceptible to the complicated dynamic deformation of myocardium during the cardiac cycle, and the invisible epicardium boundary near the lateral free wall. Regional wall thicknesses are also subject to the orientation of myocardium segments in different regions. The representation and regression models should be capable of tolerating the dynamic deformation, the imperceptible boundary and the orientation variation. Two-phase framework employed in existing direct methods~ _cite_ is inadequate to achieve accurate estimation for multitype cardiac indices, for the reason that image representation and indices regression are separately handled, and no feedback connection exists between them during optimization. In the work of~ _cite_, LV cavity area estimation was conducted through feeding directly to the neural network the proposed image statistics, which were based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient between image distributions. Avoiding the requirement of segmentation, this method still needs user interaction to indicate two closed curves within and enclosing the cavity. The proposed statistical features were further employed in the detection of regional LV abnormalities~ _cite_, where manual segmentation of a reference frame was required. In the work of~ _cite_, a Bayesian framework was build for bi-ventricular volume estimation based on multiple appearance features such as blob, homogeneity, and edge. Besides its intensive computation burden, an over simple linear correlation between areas of the two ventricular was taken into account in the prior model. Another direct estimation of bi-ventricular volumes was proposed in~ _cite_ with low level image features, i.e, Gabor features, HOG, and intensity, as input and random forest (RF) ~ _cite_ for feature selection and regression. These handcrafted features were further replaced with a more effective image representation that learned from a multiscale convolutional deep belief network (MCDBN) ~ _cite_, leading to improved correlation between the estimated volumes and their ground truth. Supervised descriptor learning (SDL) was proposed in the work of four chamber volumes estimation~ _cite_, which still employed a separate adaptive K-clustering random forest (AKRF) regression~ _cite_ . The compatibility between the descriptor and the regression model still can not be enhanced in the two-phase framework. Deep neural networks have demonstrated great power in a broad range of visual applications, as well as medical image analysis~ _cite_ for the capability of learning effective hierarchy representations in an end-to-end fashion~ _cite_ . Image representation obtained in such a way is endowed with more expressiveness with respect to the manifold structures of the image space and the target space. This property makes deep network quite suitable for the problem of cardiac indices estimation. However, in the area of cardiac image, deep networks are mostly deployed in segmentation with dense supervision of manually segmented results. Deep belief network, stacked autoencoder, and convolution neural network have been employed in cardiac segmentation with optional refinement by traditional models~ _cite_ . Fully convolution network (FCN) was applied to cardiac segmentation~ _cite_ due to its success in semantic segmentation of natural image~ _cite_ . Recurrent FCN was later proposed to leverage inter-slice spatial dependencies in cardiac segmentation~ _cite_ . Only one work for cardiac volume estimation~ _cite_ was proposed leveraging the hierarchy representation of deep neural network. In this work, a volume estimation CNN network took as input end-systole and end-diastole cardiac images (chosen by thresholding) of all slice positions, and output only two volume estimations for frames of end-systole and end-diastole. This makes the learning procedure more data-demanding and the network incapable of giving frame-wise prediction for detailed and reliable cardiac function assessment. Our proposed method is capable of estimating multitype cardiac indices for all frames throughout the whole cardiac cycle. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes in detail the proposed Indices-Net, including the joint learning procedure, the representation network DCAE and the regression network CNN. Section III gives detailed descriptions of dataset, configuration, evaluation, and experiments. The results are reported and analyzed in Section IV. Conclusions and discussions are given in Section V.
