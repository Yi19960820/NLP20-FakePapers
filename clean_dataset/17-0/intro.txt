Person re-identification aims to recognize people who have been observed from different disjoint cameras, which has become an effective tool for people association and behavior analysis in video surveillance~ _cite_ . Due to the complex variations in illumination, pose, viewpoint, occulusion and image resolution across camera views, person re-identification still remains a challenging problem in computer vision. Previously proposed approaches which improve the person re-identification performance~ _cite_ can be mainly categorized into two classes: N) developing robust descriptors to handle the variations in pedestrian images; N) designing discriminative distance metrics to measure the similarity of pedestrian images. For the first category, different cues (color, shape, texture) from pedestrian images are employed for feature representation. Representative descriptors in person re-identification include local binary patterns (LBP) ~ _cite_, ensemble of local feature (ELF) ~ _cite_, mid-level filter~ _cite_ and local maximal occurrence (LOMO) ~ _cite_ . For the second category, a distance metric is learned from labeled training samples, under which the inter-class and intra-class variations of pedestrian images are increased and decreased, respectively. Typical metric learning algorithms include large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) ~ _cite_, information theoretic metric learning (ITML) ~ _cite_, and pairwise constrained component analysis (PCCA) ~ _cite_ . While metric learning methods achieved good performance in many person re-identification systems~ _cite_, most of them learn a Mahalanobis distance metric to transform samples into a new feature space, which are not capable enough of exploiting the nonlinear relationship of pedestrian samples distributed in a nonlinear feature space due to large intra-class variations. Moreover, a single distance metric usually suffers limitations while handling data which varies locally. To address this, we propose a nonlinear local metric learning (NLML) method for person re-identification. Figure~ _ref_ illustrates the basic idea of the proposed NLML method. Unlike most existing metric learning methods, NLML develops one global feed-forward neutral network and a set of local feed-forward neutral networks to jointly learn multiple sets of nonlinear transformations. The learning procedure is formulated as a large margin optimization problem and the gradient descent algorithm is employed to estimate the networks. Experimental results on the VIPeR, GRID and CUHK N datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed NLML method.
