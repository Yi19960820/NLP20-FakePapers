Despite its essential functions, placenta biology remains poorly understood _cite_ . For instance, we lack sufficient understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking cell composition and tissue morphology to fetal growth and development. Previous research suggests there exists a direct link between placental disease and adverse effects on fetal physiology, some of which have been found to be associated with histopathological evidence of abnormality _cite_ . This supports the idea that histological phenotyping of placental tissues could fill gaps in our understanding of placental health and birth outcomes. In this work we start addressing some of these fundamental issues by developing a deep learning pipeline to automate the analysis of cell phenotyping in placenta histology. By exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning _cite_, we implement a two part workflow that can accurately localise and objectively classify cell populations in placenta imaging. Furthermore, we learn deep embeddings capable of capturing intercellular morphological variance as well as intraclass phenotypic heterogeneity. Our approach analyses placenta imaging by solving two distinct computer vision tasks. For each test image, we firstly detect nuclei by means of the nuclei localisation module; the classification module then phenotypes and segregates cells within five populations present in the placenta at term.
