We present a novel graph diffusion-embedding networks (GDEN) for graph-structured data. GDEN is motivated by our closed-form formulation on on graph. GDEN integrates both and simultaneously in a unified network model. Moreover, based on GDEN, we can naturally deal with the structured data with multiple graph structures. Experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the better performance of the proposed GDEN when comparing with the traditional GCN models.
