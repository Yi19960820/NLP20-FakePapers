ND human pose estimation from a single image is a challenging problem, especially for in-the-wild settings due to the lack of ND annotated data. We propose two anatomically inspired loss functions and use them with the weakly-supervised learning framework of~ _cite_ to jointly learn from large-scale in-the-wild ND and indoor/synthetic ND data. We also present a simple temporal network that exploits temporal and structural cues present in predicted pose sequences to temporally harmonize the pose estimations. We carefully analyze the proposed contributions through loss surface visualizations and sensitivity analysis to facilitate deeper understanding of their working mechanism. Our complete pipeline improves the state-of-the-art by N \% and N \% on N and MPI-INF-NDHP, respectively, and runs at N FPS on a commodity graphics card.
