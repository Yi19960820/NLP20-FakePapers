Action classification in still images has been a popular research topic in computer vision. Labelling large scale datasets for action classification requires tremendous manual work, which is hard to scale up. Besides, the action categories in such datasets are pre-defined and vocabularies are fixed. However humans may describe the same action with different phrases, which leads to the difficulty of vocabulary expansion for traditional fully-supervised methods. We observe that large amounts of images with sentence descriptions are readily available on the Internet. The sentence descriptions can be regarded as weak labels for the images, which contain rich information and could be used to learn flexible expressions of action categories. We propose a method to learn an Action Concept Tree (ACT) and an Action Semantic Alignment (ASA) model for classification from image-description data via a two-stage learning process. A new dataset for the task of is built. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several baseline methods significantly.
