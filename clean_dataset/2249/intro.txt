The introduction of Ultrasound Guided Regional Anaesthesia (UGRA) has rapidly become popular for performing regional anaesthesia blocks. However, this procedure requires great concentration by the operator because of many simultaneous tasks, such as nerve and needle localization, and steady probe positioning in order to maintain the nerve and the needle in the observation plane~ _cite_, _cite_ . Performing the UGRA needs a long learning process and years of practice in the operating room. Computer aided system that can detect automatically region of interest ROI, would help practitioner to concentrate more in anaesthetic delivery. Although there has been an extensive development of detection and segmentation algorithms for medical ultrasound (US) images _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, it is still an open problem especially for regional anesthesia. So far, very little attention has been paid to the nerve detection. We recently demonstrated the possibility of detecting and segmenting the sciatic nerve structure~ _cite_, the method is based on Monogenic signal and probabilistic active contour approaches. In~ _cite_ authors proposed a descriptor based on the combination of median binary pattern and Gabor filter to characterize and classify median nerve tissues. A machine learning framework was also proposed to enable robust detection of the median nerve~ _cite_ . Recent work addresses such a problem, by proposing assistive system that detect vessels and nerve region allowing path planning for needle~ _cite_ . Despite the promising results obtained, still the topic requires further development and investigation. Recently, the deep learning approach has emerged as a powerful approach to address many problems in machine learning and computer vision fields _cite_, _cite_ _cite_, _cite_ . Among deep learning methods, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been successfully applied for various computer vision tasks, including objet recognition, region of interest (ROI) detection, segmentation and so on~ _cite_, _cite_, _cite_, _cite_ . Deep learning is also gaining popularity in medical image segmentation and classification with promising results on various applications~ _cite_, _cite_ . However, this approach is still limited to static images, very little attention has been paid to dynamic information generated by the motion of the probe~ _cite_ . The purpose of this paper is to explore this type of information, motivated by the manner that human expert uses such information. In order to visualize region of interest (i.e. nerves, veins, arteries, ..), clinician scan with the transducer a given location on the patient's body. Through this scanning process, he uses dynamic information to increase confidence for nerve localisation in US images. Hence, it is interesting to use such kind of information to increase the robustness of detection and segmentation tasks. In this paper we propose a new method based on convolutional neural network and spatiotemporal consistency to segment efficiently the nerve region. Indeed, CNN architecture is not sufficient to robustly locate the nerve region. Due to the noise and different artefacts, CNN may generate non negligible rate of false positives among the detected ROIs. In order to reduce this rate, we use spatial and temporal consistency to eliminate the false positives. If a given position has a majority intersection of ROIs and steady with the same in time (through several US slices) the ROI is likely to be consistent and not a noisy one. As result, the region of interest is considered as true positive. In final phase, we use active contours based on phase and probabilistic approach ~ _cite_ to delineate the nerve contours. The structure of this paper is organized as follows. In section N, we present the method of nerve detection. Section N provides validation and evaluation of the proposed approach, followed by conclusion in Section N.
