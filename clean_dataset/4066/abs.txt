Discriminative features are critical for machine learning applications. Most existing deep learning approaches, however, rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning features, whose discriminant power is not explicitly enforced. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to train deep CNNs by imposing the intra-class compactness and the inter-class separability, so as to enhance the learned features' discriminant power. To this end, we introduce anchors, which are predefined vectors regarded as the centers for each class and fixed during training. Discriminative features are obtained by constraining the deep CNNs to map training samples to the corresponding anchors as close as possible. We propose two principles to select the anchors, and measure the proximity of two points using the Euclidean and cosine distance metric functions, which results in two novel loss functions. These loss functions require no sample pairs or triplets and can be efficiently optimized by batch stochastic gradient descent. We test the proposed method on three benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its promising results.
