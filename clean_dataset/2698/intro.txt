In this paper, we utilize a N layer deep FCNN for the task of segmentation of gliomas from MR scans. In the field of medical image analysis, U-net _cite_ is one of the oft used architecture. The network used in this work has a similar architecture as that of the aforementioned network. The network was trained on N-D axial slices (N _inline_eq_ N) extracted from FLAIR, TN, TN, and TN post contrast sequences. The architecture of the network enables semantic segmentation i.e. classify of all voxels in a slice in a single forward pass. Due the reason stated above, the inference time associated with FCNN based network are lower when compared to traditional patch based CNNs. \par Convolutional neural network and its variants being deterministic approaches tend to mis-classify voxels as lesion in regions like brain stem, cerebellum where occurrence of gliomas is anatomically impossible. We utilize N-D connected component analysis to discard components below a certain threshold for false positive reduction. Unlike previous years BraTS competitions, apart from segmentation of gliomas from MR volumes, an additional challenge of predicting the prognosis of subject using pre-operative scan was made part of the BraTS N challenge. \par For the prognosis challenge, the overall survival rate was categorized into three groups namely short survivors (prognosis, _inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ N months), mid survivors (N months _inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ N months) \& long survivors (_inline_eq_ _inline_eq_ N months) . The segmentations produced by the FCNN was used to extract first order texture and shaped based features such as entropy, skewness, circularity of lesion constituent etc. The extracted features along with age of the subject was fed to an Extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST) regressor to predict the prognosis of the subject.
