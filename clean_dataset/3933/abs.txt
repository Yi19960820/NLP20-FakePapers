We present a semi-blind, spatially-variant deconvolution technique aimed at optical microscopy that combines a local estimation step of the point spread function (PSF) and deconvolution using a spatially variant, regularized Richardson-Lucy algorithm _cite_ . To find the local PSF map in a computationally tractable way, we train a convolutional neural network to perform regression of an optical parametric model on synthetically blurred image patches. We deconvolved both synthetic and experimentally-acquired data, and achieved an improvement of image SNR of N dB on average, compared to other deconvolution algorithms.
