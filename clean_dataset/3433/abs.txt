In this work we show how these gains are possible using a single DNN for both speaker and language recognition. The unified DNN approach is shown to yield substantial performance improvements on the the N Domain Adaptation Challenge speaker recognition task (N \% reduction in EER for the out-of-domain condition) and on the NIST N Language Recognition Evaluation (N \% reduction in EER for the Ns test condition) .
