We propose the Recurrent Soft Attention Model, which integrates the visual attention from the original image to a LSTM memory cell through a down-sample network. The model recurrently transmits visual attention to the memory cells for glimpse mask generation, which is a more natural way for attention integration and exploitation in general object detection and recognition problem. We test our model under the metric of the top-N accuracy on the CIFAR-N dataset. The experiment shows that our down-sample network and feedback mechanism plays an effective role among the whole network structure.
