Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in ND shape completion. But due to GPU memory limitations, these methods can only produce low-resolution outputs. To inpaint ND models with semantic plausibility and contextual details, we introduce a hybrid framework that combines a ND Encoder-Decoder Generative Adversarial Network (ND-ED-GAN) and a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) . The ND-ED-GAN is a ND convolutional neural network trained with a generative adversarial paradigm to fill missing ND data in low-resolution. LRCN adopts a recurrent neural network architecture to minimize GPU memory usage and incorporates an Encoder-Decoder pair into a Long Short-term Memory Network. By handling the ND model as a sequence of ND slices, LRCN transforms a coarse ND shape into a more complete and higher resolution volume. While ND-ED-GAN captures global contextual structure of the ND shape, LRCN localizes the fine-grained details. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show reconstructions from corrupted models result in complete and high-resolution ND objects. \let \thefootnote \relax
