The diagnosis of skin diseases is challenging. To diagnose a skin disease, a variety of visual clues may be used such as the individual lesional morphology, the body site distribution, color, scaling and arrangement of lesions. When the individual elements are analyzed separately, the recognition process can be quite complex _cite_ . For example, the well studied skin cancer, melanoma, has four major clinical diagnosis methods: ABCD rules, pattern analysis, Menzies method and _inline_eq_-Point Checklist. To use these methods and achieve a satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, a high level of expertise is required as the differentiation of skin lesions demands a great deal of experience and expertise _cite_ . Unlike the diagnosis by human experts, which depends essentially on subjective judgment and is not always reproducible, a computer aided diagnostic system is more objective and reliable. Traditionally, one can use human-engineered feature extraction algorithms in combination with a classifier to complete this task. For some skin diseases, such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, this solution is feasible as their features are regular and predictable. However, when we extend the skin diseases to a broader range, where the features are so complex that hand-crafted feature design becomes infeasible, the traditional approach fails. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) become very popular in feature learning and object classification. The use of high performance GPUs makes it possible to train a network on a large-scale dataset so as to yield a better performance. Many studies _cite_ from the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) _cite_ have shown that the state-of-art CNN architectures are able to surpass humans in many computer vision tasks. Therefore, we propose to construct a skin disease classifier with CNNs. However, training CNNs directly using the diagnosis labels may not be viable. On the other hand, lesion characteristics, which inherently describe the visual aspects of skin diseases, arguably should be considered as the ideal ground truth for training. For example, the two images in the first column of Figure _ref_ can both be labeled with hyperpigmented and nodular lesion tags. Compared with using the sometimes ambiguous disease diagnosis labels for these two images, the use of the lesion tags can give a more consistent and precise description of the dermatology images. In this paper, we investigate the performance of CNNs trained with disease and lesion labels, respectively. We collected _inline_eq_ skin disease images from six different publicly available dermatology atlantes. We then train a multi-class CNN for disease-targeted classification and another multi-label CNN for lesion-targeted classification. Our experimental results show that the top-_inline_eq_ and top-_inline_eq_ accuracies for the disease-targeted classification are _inline_eq_ and _inline_eq_ with a mean average precision (mAP) of _inline_eq_ . While for the lesion-targeted skin disease classification, a much higher mAP of _inline_eq_ is achieved.
