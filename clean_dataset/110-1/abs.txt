In real-world practice, medical images acquired in different phases possess complementary information, {\em e.g.}, radiologists often refer to both {\em arterial} and {\em venous} scans in order to make the diagnosis. However, in medical image analysis, fusing prediction from two phases is often difficult, because (i) there is a domain gap between two phases, and (ii) the semantic labels are not pixel-wise corresponded even for images scanned from the same patient. This paper studies organ segmentation in two-phase CT scans. We propose Phase Collaborative Network (PCN), an end-to-end framework that contains both generative and discriminative modules. PCN can be mathematically explained to formulate phase-to-phase and data-to-label relations jointly. Experiments are performed on a two-phase CT dataset, on which PCN outperforms the baselines working with one-phase data by a large margin, and we empirically verify that the gain comes from inter-phase collaboration. Besides, PCN transfers well to two public single-phase datasets, demonstrating its potential applications.
