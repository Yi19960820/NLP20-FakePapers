<|startoftext|> Visual saliency is a fundamental problem in both cognitive and computational sciences, including computer vision. In this paper, we discover that a high-quality visual saliency model can be learned from multiscale features extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have had many successes in visual recognition tasks. For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. We then propose a refinement method to enhance the spatial coherence of our saliency results. Finally, aggregating multiple saliency maps computed for different levels of image segmentation can further boost the performance, yielding saliency maps better than those generated from a single segmentation. To promote further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of N challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmarks, improving the F-Measure by N \% and N \% respectively on the MSRA-B dataset and our new dataset (HKU-IS), and lowering the mean absolute error by N \% and N \% respectively on these two datasets. <|endoftext|>
 
 
  <|startoftext|> The availability of large amounts of data for visual understanding and understanding is critical for many tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing, such as image classification and segmentation. However, it is not always possible to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on such large data. For example, a CNN trained on ImageNet _cite_ is not able to learn a saliency map of a single image, but it can learn a saliency from the input image, which is not always available. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature, and it has been addressed in several works, such as the ImageNet dataset _cite_. In the literature, the goal of this work is to develop a CNN model for image classification and segmentation, but this is not always feasible. For example, in the ImageNet dataset _cite_, a CNN trained on ImageNet is not able to learn an image-level saliency map of the same image. In this work, we explore how to train a CNN model to learn saliency from images, and we present the first attempt of this approach, namely the DeepCNN model, which is a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNets) trained on ImageNet _cite_. We use the ConvNets to train a CNN model for visual recognition tasks such as classification and detection. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the performance of the CNN in the ImageNet dataset _cite_, which contains over N million images and N million pixels. The proposed CNN model is based on a fully connected layer, which consists of three layers, one for each pixel, and the other two layers for each pixel. In the first layer, we use the convolutional layer to extract features from the image, and the convolutional layer is responsible for generating saliency map of the same image. In the second layer, we use the global convolutional layer to generate saliency map. The global convolutional layer is responsible for generating saliency map of a similar image. The global convolutional layer is responsible for generating saliency map of a similar image. The global convolutional layer is responsible for generating saliency map of a similar image.
