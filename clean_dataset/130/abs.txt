A major element of depth perception and ND understanding is the ability to predict the ND layout of a scene and its contained objects for a novel pose. Indoor environments are particularly suitable for novel view prediction, since the set of objects in such environments is relatively restricted. In this work we address the task of ND prediction especially for indoor scenes by leveraging only weak supervision. In the literature ND scene prediction is usually solved via a ND voxel grid. However, such methods are limited to estimating rather coarse ND voxel grids, since predicting entire voxel spaces has large computational costs. Hence, our method operates in image-space rather than in voxel space, and the task of ND estimation essentially becomes a depth image completion problem. We propose a novel approach to easily generate training data containing depth maps with realistic occlusions, and subsequently train a network for completing those occluded regions. Using multiple publicly available dataset~ _cite_ we benchmark our method against existing approaches and are able to obtain superior performance. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our method by presenting results for new view synthesis of RGB-D images.
