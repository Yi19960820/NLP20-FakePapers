Compressive sensing (CS) theory _cite_ is able to acquire measurements of signals at sub-Nyquist rates and recover signals with high probability when the signals are sparse in a certain domain. Greedy algorithms _cite_, convex optimization algorithms _cite_, and iterative algorithms _cite_ have been used for recovering images in conventional CS. However, almost all these methods recover images by solving an optimization problem, which is time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational complexity in the reconstruction stage, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to replace the optimization process. CNN-based methods _cite_ use big data _cite_ to train the networks that speed up the reconstruction stage. Mousavi, Patel, and Baraniuk _cite_ firstly propose deep learning approach to solve the CS recovery problem. They use stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA) to recover signals from undersampled measurements. ReconNet _cite_ and DeepInverse _cite_ introduce CNNs to the reconstruction problem, where the random Gaussian measurement matrix is used to generate the measurements. Instead, the methods _cite_ using adaptive measurement learn a transformation from signals to the measurements. This mechanism allows measurements to retain more information from images. The methods mentioned above divide an image into blocks, which breaks the structure information of the image. This will cause the block effect in the reconstructed image. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional measurement network for CS image reconstruction. Instead of block-wise methods, a convolutional layer is applied to obtain the measurement from a full image, which keeps the integrity of structure information of the original image. Furthermore, motivated by the residual learning proposed by ResNet _cite_, we apply residual connection block (Resblock) in the proposed network for improvement. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method N _inline_eq_ NdB in PSNR at different measurement rates. The organization of this paper is as follows. The related works using deep learning methods for the CS reconstruction problem are introduced in Section _ref_ . Section _ref_ presents the proposed fully convolutional measurement network. Section _ref_ shows experimental results of the proposed method and the previous works. The conclusion of this paper is drawn in Section _ref_ .
