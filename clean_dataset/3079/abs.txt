Deep networks trained on millions of facial images are believed to be closely approaching human-level performance in face recognition. However, open world face recognition still remains a challenge. Although, ND face recognition has an inherent edge over its ND counterpart, it has not benefited from the recent developments in deep learning due to the unavailability of large training as well as large test datasets. Recognition accuracies have already saturated on existing ND face datasets due to their small gallery sizes. Unlike ND photographs, ND facial scans cannot be sourced from the web causing a bottleneck in the development of deep ND face recognition networks and datasets. In this backdrop, we propose a method for generating a large corpus of labeled ND face identities and their multiple instances for training and a protocol for merging the most challenging existing ND datasets for testing. We also propose the first deep CNN model designed specifically for ND face recognition and trained on N Million ND facial scans of NK identities. Our test dataset comprises N, N identities with a single ND scan in the gallery and another NK scans as probes, which is several orders of magnitude larger than existing ones. Without fine tuning on this dataset, our network already outperforms state of the art face recognition by over N \%. We fine tune our network on the gallery set to perform end-to-end large scale ND face recognition which further improves accuracy. Finally, we show the efficacy of our method for the open world face recognition problem.
