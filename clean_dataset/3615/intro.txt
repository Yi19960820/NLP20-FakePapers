Compression of high-quality thumbnails is an active area of research~ _cite_ as the demand for image content over connections of all speeds continues to quickly rise. In addition to the decreased download latency and bandwidth consumption that is particularly important to the ``next billion users'' (NBU), reducing the compressed-image size also helps with storage requirements for the billions of thumbnails needed for rapid access~ _cite_ . Two standard measures of compression quality are PSNR and SSIM~ _cite_ . However, at such high-compression rates (N bytes per thumbnail image, which is N bpp for _inline_eq_ thumbnails), we have found that these metrics do not adequately reflect subjective preferences. Therefore, in addition to using PSNR and SSIM, we measure how well semantic information, in terms of recognizable objects and scenes, is preserved. Similarly, at these extreme-compression rates, JPEG and other standard approaches do not fare well. Usually, when extreme compression is required, it is addressed with domain-specific techniques: for example, faces~ _cite_, satellite imagery~ _cite_, smooth synthetic images~ _cite_, or surveillance~ _cite_ . For non-specialized image-compression, ~ _cite_ is a leading compression format. When used on small images, WebP yields better compression than both JPEG and JPEGN standards~ _cite_ . The fundamental operation of both WebP and JPEG is a subdivision of the image into a set of blocks. Alternative approaches have used triangulation~ _cite_ . The most recent of these, ~ _cite_, has shown promising results on a wide variety of natural images. Their approach creates an adaptive Delaunay~ _cite_ triangulation of the target image, based on the underlying entropy of the local pixel distributions. The result is a mesh in which a larger number of triangles are devoted to the complex (high-entropy) regions, while smooth patches of the image are approximated with fewer triangles. After transmission, the decoder renders the triangles by interpolating the vertex colors. The performance of the triangulation method in~ _cite_ provides a strong encoder that works well precisely in the regime of interest: transmission of images under N bytes. At that small size, image previews can be easily transmitted as part of the original page-load process on mobile devices or on bandwidth limited connections~ _cite_ . When measured in terms of PSNR or SSIM~ _cite_, the triangulation method significantly outperformed JPEG and WebP. However, when the images were visually inspected, their visual quality was very uneven: see Figure~ _ref_ (row b) for examples. Though some of the images appear very well reconstructed (Figure~ _ref_ left columns), others are unrecognizable when viewed without the reference. Other images resulted in spurious edges formed by the triangulation boundaries (Figure~ _ref_ right columns) . To address these shortcomings, we replace the decoder with a deep convolutional neural network. We ensure that the network remains relatively modest in size for ease of deployment. The decoder input-feature representations played a crucial role for good performance: we provide details in Section~ _ref_ . The results, presented in Section~ _ref_, reveal not only improved PSNR and SSIM scores, but also semantic-content preservation that is quantitatively measured as far superior. Deep neural networks for compression have been studied in a variety of configurations, from shallow~ _cite_ and deep feed-forward auto-encoders~ _cite_ to recurrent neural nets/LSTMs for variable-length encodings~ _cite_ . Others have taken approaches more closely tied in spirit to ours: employing established encodings as the inputs and using neural networks as the basis for a new decoder with improved performance. These techniques effectively learn a mapping from decompressed patches back to the original image, for example to remove JPEG compression artifacts~ _cite_ . Finally, though we do not explore generative adversarial networks (GANs) in this paper, we will briefly address how they can easily be used in a manner similar to other super-resolution and compression studies~ _cite_ .
