Automatic sign language recognition is an open problem that has received a lot of attention recently, not only because of its usefulness to signers, but also due to the numerous applications a sign classifier can have. In this article, we present a new feature extraction technique for hand pose recognition using depth and intensity images captured from a Microsoft Kinect \texttrademark sensor. We applied our technique to American Sign Language fingerspelling classification using a Deep Belief Network, for which our feature extraction technique is tailored. We evaluated our results on a multi-user data set with two scenarios: one with all known users and one with an unseen user. We achieved N~ \% recall and precision on the first, and N~ \% recall and N~ \% precision on the second. Our method is also capable of real-time sign classification and is adaptive to any environment or lightning intensity.
