We develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, which enhances the performance of dentists in detecting wide range of dental caries. The CAD System achieves this by acting as a second opinion for the dentists with way higher sensitivity on the task of detecting cavities than the dentists themselves. We develop annotated dataset of more than N bitewing radiographs and utilize it for developing a system for automated diagnosis of dental caries. Our system consists of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) consisting N + layers, which is trained to mark caries on bitewing radiographs. We have compared the performance of our proposed system with three certified dentists for marking dental caries. We exceed the average performance of the dentists in both recall (sensitivity) and FN-Score (agreement with truth) by a very large margin. Working example of our system is shown in Figure~ _ref_ .
