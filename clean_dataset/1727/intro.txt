Registration of point clouds integrates ND data from different sources into a common coordinate system, serving as an essential component of many high-level applications like ND modeling _cite_, SLAM _cite_ and robotic perception _cite_ . Critical to a registration task is the determination of correspondences between spatially localized ND points within each cloud. To tackle the correspondence problem, on the one hand, a bunch of ND local descriptors _cite_ have been developed to facilitate the description of ND keypoints. On the other hand, matching strategies _cite_ have also been progressing towards higher accuracy and robustness. The exploration of ND geometric descriptors has long been the focus of interest in point cloud registration. It involves the hand-crafted geometric descriptors _cite_ as well as the learned ones _cite_ . Both kinds of methods mainly rely on ND local geometries. Meanwhile, with the significant progress of CNN-based ND patch descriptors _cite_, more importance is attached to leveraging the ND projections for the description of underlying ND structures _cite_ . Particularly for the point cloud data generally co-registered with camera images _cite_, the fusion of multiple image views, which has reported success on various tasks _cite_, is expected to further improve the discriminative power of ND local descriptors. With this motivation, we propose a multi-view descriptor, named MVDesc, for the description of ND keypoints based on the synergy of the multi-view fusion techniques and patch descriptor learning. Rather than a replacement, the MVDesc is well complementary to existing geometric descriptors _cite_ . Given the local descriptors, the matching problem is another vital issue in point cloud registration. A set of outlier-free point matches is desired by most registration algorithms _cite_ . Currently, the matching strategies, \eg, the nearest neighbor search, mutual best _cite_ and ratio test _cite_, basically estimate correspondences according to the similarities of local descriptors alone. Without considering the global geometric consistency, these methods are prone to spurious matches between locally-similar ND structures. Efforts are also spent on jointly solving the outlier suppression via line process and the optimization of global registration _cite_ . But the spatial organizations of ND point matches are still overlooked when identifying outliers. To address this, we develop a robust matching approach by explicitly considering the spatial consistency of point matches in ND space. We seek to filter outlier matches based on a graphical model describing their spatial properties and provide an efficient solution via belief propagation. The main contributions of this work can be summarized twofold. N) We are the first to leverage the fusion of multiple image views for the description of ND keypoints when tackling point cloud registration. N) The proposed effective and efficient outlier filter, which is based on a graphical model and solved by belief propagation, remarkably enhances the robustness of ND point matching.
