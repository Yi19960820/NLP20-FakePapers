In this work we present a new method for data deconvolution from a single acquisition without a sparsity prior, that allows the retrieval of the target function with super-resolution. The measured data are fit by a superposition of virtual point sources (SUPPOSe) of equal intensity. The cloud of virtual point sources approximates the actual distribution of sources that can be discrete or continuous. In this manner only the positions of the sources need to be determined by an algorithm, that minimizes the norm of the difference between the measured data and the convolution of the superposed point sources with the Instrument Response Function. An upper bound for the uncertainty in the position of the sources was derived and two very different experimental situations were used for the test (an optical spectrum and fluorescent microscopy images) showing excellent reconstructions and agreement with the predicted uncertainties, achieving _inline_eq_ resolution for the microscope and a fivefold improvement in the spectral resolution for the spectrometer. The method also provides a way to determine the optimum number of sources to be used for the fit.
