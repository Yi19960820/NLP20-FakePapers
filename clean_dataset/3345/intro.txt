extraction is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of remote sensing. It has a wide range of applications such as automatic road navigation, unmanned vehicles, urban planning, and geographic information update, etc. Although it has been received considerable attentions in the last decade, road extraction from high resolution remote sensing images is still a challenging task because of the noise, occlusions and complexity of the background in raw remote sensing imagery. A variety of methods have been proposed to extract roads from remote sensing images in recent years. Most of these methods can be divided into two categories: road area extraction and road centerline extraction. Road area extraction~ _cite_ can generate pixel-level labeling of roads, while road centerline extraction~ _cite_ aims at detecting skeletons of a road. There are also methods extract both road areas and centerline, simultaneously~ _cite_ . Since road centerline can be easily obtained from road areas using algorithms such as morphological thinning~ _cite_, this letter focuses on road area extraction from high resolution remote sensing images. Road area extraction can be considered as a segmentation or pixel-level classification problem. For instance, Song and Civco~ _cite_ proposed a method utilizing shape index feature and support vector machine (SVM) to detect road areas. Das et al.~ _cite_ exploited two salient features of roads and designed a multistage framework to extract roads from high resolution multi-spectral images using probabilistic SVM. Alshehhi and Marpu~ _cite_ proposed an unsupervised road extraction method based on hierarchical graph-based image segmentation. Recent years have witnessed great progress in deep learning. Methods based on deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of computer vision tasks, such as scene recognition~ _cite_ and object detection~ _cite_ . Researchers in remote sensing community also seek to leverage the power of deep neural networks to solve the problems of interpretation and understanding of remote sensing data~ _cite_ . These methods provide better results than traditional ones, showing great potential of applying deep learning techniques to analyze remote sensing tasks. In the field of road extraction, one of the first attempts of applying deep learning techniques was made by Mnih and Hinton~ _cite_ . They proposed a method employing restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to detect road areas from high resolution aerial images. To achieve better results, a pre-processing step before the detection and a post-processing step after the detection were applied. The pre-processing was deployed to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. The post-processing was employed to remove disconnected blotches and fill in the holes in the roads. Different from Mnih and Hinton's method~ _cite_ that use RBMs as basic blocks to built deep neural networks, Saito et al.~ _cite_ employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to extract buildings and roads directly from raw remote sensing imagery. This method achieves better results than Mnih and Hinton's method~ _cite_ on the Massachusetts roads dataset. Recently, lots of works have suggested that a deeper network would have better performance~ _cite_ . However, it is very difficult to train a very deep architecture due to problems such as vanishing gradients. To overcome this problem, He et al.~ _cite_ proposed the deep residual learning framework that utilize an identity mapping~ _cite_ to facilitate training. Instead of using skip connection in Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) ~ _cite_, Ronneberger et al.~ _cite_ proposed the U-Net that concatenate feature maps from different levels to improve segmentation accuracy. U-Net combines low level detail information and high level semantic information, thus achieves promising performance on biomedical image segmentation~ _cite_ . Inspired by the deep residual learning~ _cite_ and U-Net~ _cite_, in this letter we propose the deep residual U-Net, an architecture that take advantage of strengths from both deep residual learning and U-Net architecture. The proposed deep residual U-Net (ResUnet) is built based on the architecture of U-Net. The differences between our deep ResUnet and U-Net are in two-fold. First, we use residual units instead of plain neural units as basic blocks to build the deep ResUnet. Second, the cropping operation is unnecessary thus removed from our network, leading to a much more elegant architecture and better performance.
