We present a logarithmic-scale efficient convolutional neural network architecture for edge devices, named WaveletNet. Our model is based on the well-known depthwise convolution, and on two new layers, which we introduce in this work: a wavelet convolution and a depthwise fast wavelet transform. By breaking the symmetry in channel dimensions and applying a fast algorithm, WaveletNet shrinks the complexity of convolutional blocks by an _inline_eq_ factor, where _inline_eq_ is the number of channels. Experiments on CIFAR-N and ImageNet classification show superior and comparable performances of WaveletNet compared to state-of-the-art models such as MobileNetVN.
