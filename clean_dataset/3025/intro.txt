Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a unique tool for noninvasively probing the microstructure of the neuronal tissue by capturing the displacement pattern of water molecules~ _cite_ . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was first developed to model the anisotropy of water diffusion using a Gaussian model, where fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity can be computed to describe tissue microstructure. More complex methods have been proposed for improved diffusion modeling using biophysical models consisting of different tissue compartments, such as CHARMED~ _cite_, ActiveAx~ _cite_, and NODDI~ _cite_ . Among the existing algorithms for microstructure estimation, the NODDI model has been a popular choice in a number of scientific studies, for example, on brain development~ _cite_ or pathological changes caused by diseases~ _cite_ . The NODDI model distinguishes three different types of diffusion in tissue, leading to the intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments~ _cite_ . By relating these compartments with observed diffusion signals, the parameters in the NODDI model are estimated with a maximum likelihood approach. The contribution of each compartment, the mean orientation of the intra-cellular compartment, and the orientation dispersion are then achieved, which give estimates of the tissue microstructural organization. The NODDI model uses a computationally expensive procedure to fit the model, and thus requires powerful computer clusters and/or takes a long computation time~ _cite_ . To efficiently solve the NODDI model, a dictionary-based framework has been proposed in the AMICO algorithm~ _cite_, where the microstructure estimation is accelerated drastically. AMICO computes the mean orientation beforehand using DTI and estimates the CSF volume fraction, intra-cellular volume fraction, and orientation dispersion. First, it uses a dictionary that encodes discretized NODDI parameters to represent the diffusion signals. The mixture fractions ~ (MFs) of the dictionary atoms can be estimated by solving a regularized least squares problem. The MF associated with the CSF atom provides an estimate of the CSF volume fraction. The other MFs, after normalization, linearly weight the discretized NODDI parameters to compute the rest of the microstructural properties. However, NODDI or AMICO could require a large number of diffusion gradients for accurate microstructure estimation, which may limit their clinical use. Thus, a multi-layer perceptron was used in~ _cite_ to estimate scalar quantities including the NODDI parameters with a reduce number of diffusion gradients. Efficient and accurate NODDI microstructure estimation using the number of diffusion gradients that is clinically practical (for example, around N) is still an open problem. In this work, we design a deep network to predict the NODDI microstructural properties. The method is named Microstructure Estimation using a Deep Network ~ (MEDN) . Because the mean orientation can be estimated accurately using the simple DTI model~ _cite_, we focus on the scalar NODDI parameters like~ _cite_ . Unlike~ _cite_, where a general multi-layer perceptron is used, the deep network in MEDN is designed specifically for the estimation of NODDI parameters. The proposed network structure is motivated by the AMICO~ _cite_ procedure and comprises two cascaded stages where all the weights are jointly learned for microstructure prediction. The first stage uses a network structure that unfolds an iterative process similar to iterative hard thresholding~ _cite_, and can solve a dictionary-based sparse reconstruction problem after the network weights are learned~ _cite_ . In the second stage, one of the output of the first stage corresponds to the CSF volume fraction; the other outputs are normalized and weighted to predict the intra-cellular volume fraction and orientation dispersion (after a transformation), where the weights are also learned. Like~ _cite_, for each dMRI dataset acquired with a fixed imaging protocol, one deep network is trained. To generate the training data, we use a strategy similar to~ _cite_, which requires training dMRI scans acquired with diffusion gradients that densely sample the _inline_eq_-space. The microstructure estimated by AMICO on the training images are then used to train the network, where the sum of the mean squared errors of the CSF volume fraction, intra-cellular volume fraction, and orientation dispersion is used as the loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on brain dMRI scans, where two shells each with N gradient directions were used, and the results demonstrate that MEDN outperforms the competitors.
