\vskip-N Compressed sensing _cite_ is a mathematical framework that defines the conditions and tools for the recovery of a signal from a small number of its linear projections (i.e. measurements) . In the CS framework, the measurement device acquires the signal in the linear projections domain, and the full signal is reconstructed by convex optimization techniques. CS has diverse applications including image acquisition _cite_, radar imaging _cite_, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) _cite_, spectrum sensing _cite_, indoor positioning _cite_, bio-signals acquisition _cite_, and sensor networks _cite_ . In this paper we address the problem of block-based CS (BCS) _cite_, which employs CS on distinct low-dimensional segments of a high-dimensional signal. BCS is mostly suitable for processing very high-dimensional images and video, where it operates on distinct local patches. Our approach is based on a deep neural network _cite_, which simultaneously learns the linear sensing matrix and the non-linear reconstruction operator. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (N) It presents for the first time, to the best knowledge of the authors, the utilization of a fully-connected deep neural network for the task of BCS; and (N) The proposed network performs both the linear sensing and non-linear reconstruction operators, and during training these operators are optimized, leading to a significant advantage compared to state-of-the-art. This paper is organized as follows: section _ref_ introduces CS concepts, and motivates the utilization of BCS for very high-dimensional images and video. Section _ref_ presents the deep neural network approach, and discusses structure and training aspects. Section _ref_ evaluates the performance of the proposed approach for compressively sensing and reconstructing natural images, and compares it with state-of-the-art BCS methods and full-image Total Variation-based CS. Section _ref_ concludes the paper and discusses future research directions. \vskip-N
