Accurate detection and localization for angiodysplasia lesions is an important problem in early stage diagnostics of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Gold-standard for angiodysplasia detection and localization is performed using wireless capsule endoscopy. This pill-like device is able to produce thousand of high enough resolution images during one passage through gastrointestinal tract. In this paper we present our winning solution for MICCAI N Endoscopic Vision SubChallenge: Angiodysplasia Detection and Localization its further improvements over the state-of-the-art results using several novel deep neural network architectures. It address the binary segmentation problem, where every pixel in an image is labeled as an angiodysplasia lesions or background. Then, we analyze connected component of each predicted mask. Based on the analysis we developed a classifier that predict angiodysplasia lesions (binary variable) and a detector for their localization (center of a component) . In this setting, our approach outperforms other methods in every task subcategory for angiodysplasia detection and localization thereby providing state-of-the-art results for these problems.
