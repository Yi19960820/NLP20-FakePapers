Precise ND segmentation of infant brain tissues is an essential step towards comprehensive volumetric studies and quantitative analysis of early brain developement. However, computing such segmentations is very challenging, especially for N-month infant brain, due to the poor image quality, among other difficulties inherent to infant brain MRI, e.g., the isointense contrast between white and gray matter and the severe partial volume effect due to small brain sizes. This study investigates the problem with an ensemble of {\em semi-dense} fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which employs TN-weighted and TN-weighted MR images as input. We demonstrate that {\em the ensemble agreement is highly correlated with the segmentation errors} . Therefore, our method provides measures that can guide local user corrections. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first ensemble of ND CNNs for suggesting annotations within images. Furthermore, inspired by the very recent success of {\em dense} networks _cite_, we propose a novel architecture,, which connects all convolutional layers directly to the end of the network. Our architecture allows the efficient propagation of gradients during training, while limiting the number of parameters, requiring one order of magnitude less parameters than popular medical image segmentation networks such as ND U-Net _cite_ . Another contribution of our work is the study of the impact that early or late fusions of multiple image modalities might have on the performances of deep architectures. We report evaluations of our method on the public data of the MICCAI iSEG-N Challenge on N-month infant brain MRI segmentation, and show very competitive results among N teams, ranking first or second in most metrics.
