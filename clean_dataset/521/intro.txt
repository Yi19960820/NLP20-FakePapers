The accurate localization and classification of musical symbols is a key component in every functioning Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system _cite_ . In pursuit of our goal of advancing the state of the art in optical music symbol detection we have created the large _cite_ dataset of synthetic music scores together with ground truth to enable the training of very deep neural networks. Additionally, we created a custom object detection method called Deep Watershed Detection _cite_, that is designed to work particularly well on optical music notation data. Both these contributions currently carry some drawbacks and flaws that hamper performance and usability. In this paper, we give an overview of our current as well as planned efforts to alleviate these issues.
