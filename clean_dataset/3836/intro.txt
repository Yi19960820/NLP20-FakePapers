Recognizing human actions in videos has been a popular research field in recent years with a wide range of applications, including video surveillance, human-computer interaction, etc. Recent research mainly focuses on the realistic datasets collected from web videos or digital movies _cite_ . These real-world scenarios impose great challenges for action recognition, e.g. the high-dimension of video data and large intra-class variations caused by scale, viewpoints, illumination. To deal with such challenges, many researchers attempt to explore effective and robust video representation methods for dynamics modeling. One popular family of approaches employ low-level representation schemes, e.g. local space-time descriptors (STIP _cite_, ND SIFT _cite_, Extended SURF _cite_, HOGND _cite_), dynamic texture (LTP _cite_, MIP _cite_), and optical flow based method (MBH _cite_, Dense Trajectory _cite_) . A bag-of-features encoding of these low-level features can be directly used for action recognition and some of them have reported the state-of-the-art performance _cite_ . Another line of research extracts high-level information of human motion shape by constructing explicit models of bodies, silhouettes, or space-time volumes _cite_ . More recently, Action Bank _cite_, is proposed to construct a bank of action templates for high-level representation, which leads to good performance and also possesses semantic meaning. While certain success has been achieved in both two lines mentioned above, there still remains several unresolved limitations. For low-level features, the local patterns are repeatable and thus robust to intra-class variation, but lack of descriptive and discriminative ability. In contrast, high-level features possess the global semantic information, which however simultaneously brings sensitivities to unprofitable variations and deformations. To balance between the low-level and high-level, a couple of recent works propose to learn mid-level representations, e.g. Action-Gons _cite_, Actons _cite_, motionlets _cite_, motion atoms \& phrases _cite_, which are expected to possess both local repeatability and global descriptive ability. In both _cite_ and _cite_, the mid-level units are constructed by clustering groups of low-level features, then the video representation is obtained by encoding these mid-level features using activation or correlation functions. In light of such progresses, in this paper, we propose a novel mid-level representation with several encoding methods to further improve the performance. Compared with the former work, our contribution lies in three aspects: (N) We consider a global alignment among video samples to build semantic correspondence for matching and alleviate the influence of unexpected noise caused by realistic scenario; (N) We employ three types of statistics from different perspectives, i.e. linear subspace, covariance matrix, and Gaussian distribution, for mid-level words modeling, which introduce some non-Euclidean spaces, i.e. Riemannian manifolds, for feature diversity; (N) Different encoding methods on Riemannian manifold are investigated for effective video representation and further improving the performance. An overview of our method is illustrated in Figure~ _ref_ . The upper part shows the procedure of mid-level words construction: groups of low-level features are globally aligned via GMM and then modeled as mid-level words statistically. The lower part depicts the mid-level words encoding on Riemannian manifold: intrinsic Riemannian codebooks are generated and different encoding methods can be conducted on Riemannian manifold for the overall video representations. Finally, linear SVM is employed for recognition. Our method is evaluated in two tasks on four realistic datasets: action recognition on YouTube _cite_, UCFN _cite_ and HMDBN _cite_ databases, and action similarity labeling on ASLAN database _cite_ . The experiments demonstrate the benefits of encoding mid-level words on Riemannian manifold compared with the original descriptors. By fusing descriptors and different mid-level words modeling strategies, our results achieve the state-of-the-art on all databases.
