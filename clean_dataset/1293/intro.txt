Dental caries (also known as Dental Cavities) are major oral health problem in most industrialized countries, affecting more than one-fourth of U.S. children aged two to five, half of those aged between twelve to fifteen, and more than N percent of U.S. adults over age N _cite_ . Consequently, dental services (including diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the diseases related to oral cavity) are among the fastest growing sectors in the healthcare industry _cite_ . Dentists often use bitewing radiographs as assisting tools to locate dental caries. This, however, is a challenging task. Dentists rely on clinical experience and patientâ€™s medical history as additional information for corroborating their caries findings on radiographs. Even experienced dentists miss cavities with high probability (N \%-N \%) _cite_, if presented with just the bitewing radiographs. Further, intra-as well as inter-examiner agreement between dentists are very low _cite_ . Automating the dental caries detection process has huge potential in raising standards of medical care by providing increased efficiency and reliability. Our contributions in the present work are as follows: We develop a System that has better agreement (FN-Score) with clinically verified data as compared to N dentists we work with during our study. On top of this the sensitivity of the system is higher than dentists as well. The study was approved by IRB.
