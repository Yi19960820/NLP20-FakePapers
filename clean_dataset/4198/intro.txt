We explore the variations of those factors in two full factorial designs. Our main experiment evaluates nine factors, for five different test datasets, resulting in _inline_eq_ treatments. Our assessment of transfer learning evaluates eight factors for five datasets, with _inline_eq_ treatments. We analyze those results using multi-way, to obtain decisions that generalize across datasets. This paper follows our participation at the International Skin Imaging Collaboration---ISIC N Challenge~ _cite_ . At the time, with a strategy of aggressively optimizing our models, we were ranked first in melanoma classification~ _cite_, with an of N: We organized the remaining text as follows: we discuss the recent state of the art in Section~ _ref_, and very briefly overview our participation on ISIC Challenge N. We detail our goals, materials, and methods in Section~ _ref_ . Experimental results and analyses appear in Section~ _ref_ . Finally, we review and discuss the main findings in Section~ _ref_ .
