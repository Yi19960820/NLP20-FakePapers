There is increasing interest in Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) for both clinical and preclinical imaging _cite_, as it has the potential to provide molecular and functional information with high spatial resolution _cite_ . For preclinical imaging it is often possible to make measurements all around the object, but for clinical imaging, PAT scanners with access to just one side of the tissue are typically required. In addition, clinical imaging typically requires high frame rates _cite_ . The frame rate is determined both by the time taken for the data acquisition as well as by the image reconstruction time. Compressed sensing can dramatically reduce data acquisition time, but then suitable image reconstruction approaches are required, which are typically slow due to the large number of iterations required. This paper proposes to use an approximate and fast model within a deep learning framework for PAT image reconstruction from sparse data measured using a planar scanner.
