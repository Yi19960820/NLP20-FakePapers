Primary and secondary liver lesions can have heterogeneous shape and appearance in image data and thus are very challenging to be segmented automatically. Currently, an acceptable quality level can only be achieved with interactive segmentation approaches. In this paper, we describe a fully automatic method for liver tumor segmentation, which employs cascaded CNNs similar to _cite_, to provide a liver and tumor segmentation. We additionally filter the tumor candidates by means of shape-and image-based features computed for each candidate. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sec. _ref_ we describe our method for extracting a liver mask from a given CT volume, followed by the liver tumor segmentation outlined in Sec. \, _ref_ . In Sec. _ref_, we report the training time and inference time per volume of our method together with results achieved on the challenge test data. We conclude in Sec. _ref_ .
