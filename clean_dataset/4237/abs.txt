\boldmath Automatic image annotation has been an important research topic in facilitating large scale image management and retrieval. Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-_inline_eq_ retrieval performance, where _inline_eq_ is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-_inline_eq_ evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.
