Facial beauty analysis~ _cite_ has been widely used in many fields such as facial image beautification APPs (e.g., MeiTu and Facetune), plastic surgery, and face-based pose analysis~ _cite_ . In the mobile computing era, billions of images per day are acquired and uploaded to social networks and online platform, leading to the demand for better image processing and analyzing technology. Recently, thanks to the big data and high-performance computational hardware, computational and data-driven approaches have been proposed for solving these questions such as face recognition, facial expression recognition, facial beauty analysis and etc. The existing methods resort to machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze facial beauty and achieve promising results _cite_ . The methods often include image feature descriptors (such as HOG, SIFT, LBP, etc) and supervised machine learning predictors (such as SVM, KNN, DNN, LR, etc) . In order to explore the best facial beauty prediction approach that precisely maps high-level features into face beauty ratings, we propose a method that combines transfer learning and Bayesian regression. The method achieves the improved or comparable performance on SCUT-FBP dataset~ _cite_ and ECCV HotOrNot dataset~ _cite_ . The main contributions of this paper are as follows: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section \uppercase reviews the related works of facial descriptor and learning methods. Section \uppercase describes our proposed method in details, which include deep feature extraction and Bayesian ridge regression. Experimental results and comparisons are presented in Section \uppercase and Section \uppercase concludes this paper with a summary and future work.
